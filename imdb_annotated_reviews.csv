0,"If you're a Millennial like me, you probably experienced the phenomena known as 'Titanic-mania' during your childhood, where everyone was obsessed with this movie. It was in theatres for almost a year, and every girl between 8-20 was obsessed with Leonardo DiCaprio. Titanic was everywhere in the late 1990s, and because of its popularity and reputation as a gushy romance movie popular with teenage girls, it attracted a lot of hate. Despite winning numerous Oscars, Titanic, for the longest time, had a negative reputation, especially among men.In hindsight, if you had your image of Titanic shaped by the negative media landscape surrounding it in the late 90s to the 2000s, I highly suggest you give it another go. It really is a wonderful film, and it's enjoyable and fun even if you're a guy. The special effects are second to none, the acting is great and James Horner's soundtrack is absolutely majestic. Even the love story itself, while a bit gushy in parts, is actually quite sweet and endearing. Both Rose and Jack are full realized, strong characters who you care about.My advice, especially to 20-30 something year old men who were told all their life that 'Titanic sucks', is to give it a chance. You're sleeping on not only a great drama, but a great action movie as well.",your millenni like probabl experienc phenomenon known titanicmania childhood everyon ob movi theatr almost year everi girl ob leonardo dicaprio titan everywher late popular reput gushi romanc movi popular teenag girl attract lot hate despit win numer oscar titan longest time neg reput especi among menin hindsight imag titan shape neg medium landscap surround late highli suggest give anoth go realli wonder film enjoy fun even your guy special effect second none act great jame horner soundtrack absolut majest even love stori bit gushi part actual quit sweet endear rose jack full realiz strong charact care aboutmi advic especi someth year old men told life titan suck give chanc your sleep great drama great action movi well,positive
1,"I've never watched Titanic until now. It caught my interest when I heard the story about those 5 people who lost their lives on an expedition to the Titanic.I've heard about this movie for years and finally decided to watch it. It's honestly one of the best movies I've seen. I had so many emotions watching it. Laughter, tears, anger, terror etc.The characters were phenomenal. To think of all of those people who really went through pure terror. I couldn't imagine.Needless to say, if you have not seen this movie, please go watch it. I had to add it to my list of favorite movies.Job well done to everyone involved in making this masterpiece.",ive never watch titan caught interest heard stori peopl lost live expedit titanic heard movi year final decid watch honestli one best movi ive seen mani emot watch laughter tear anger terror etcth charact phenomen think peopl realli went pure terror couldnt imagineneedless say seen movi plea go watch add list favorit moviesjob well done everyon involv make masterpiec,positive
2,"I avoided watching this film for the longest time. Long before it was even released I had dismissed it as an over-hyped, over-blown, overly romanticized piece of Hollywood schmaltz, and I wanted nothing to do with it. I never watched it in the theatre. I shook my head in disbelief at the 11 Academy Awards - even though I had never seen it. Then I was asked to be a judge at a high school public speaking contest. One of the girls spoke about this movie. ""It was so great,"" she said. ""You really felt like you were on the ship."" ""Nonsense,"" I thought. I shared my feelings with my fellow judges. One looked at me and said, ""you might be right, but if she liked the movie that much maybe she'll want to learn more about the real Titanic. The movie must have done something right to get her so interested."" ""Well, maybe,"" thought I. Then it finally appeared on Pay TV. ""OK,"" I thought, ""I'll give it a look see."" I didn't want to like it - and I didn't. I loved it! What a great movie.Where to start? First - the directing. My high school public speaking contestant was right. James Cameron does a superb job of creating an almost ""you are there"" type of atmosphere. The gaiety of life aboard the most elegant ship in the world. The nonchalance as news of the iceberg first spreads; then the rising sense of panic. You don't just watch it; you really do feel it. Then - the performances. The lead performances from Kate Winslet (as Rose) and Leonardo DiCaprio (as Jack) are excellent - Winslet's being the superior, I thought, but both were good. They had their rich girl/poor boy characters down to a perfect ""t"" I thought. In my opinion, though, stealing the show was Frances Fisher as Rose's mother. She was perfect as the snobby aristocrat, and you could feel the fear and loathing she felt every time she looked at Jack. Then - the details. I'm no expert on the sinking of the Titanic, but I have a reasonable general knowledge, and this film does a super job of recreating the historical details accurately and then weaving them seamlessly around the fictional romance. Very impressive, indeed. Then - the song. Who can watch this movie and not be taken with Celine Dion's performance of ""My Heart Goes On.""Problems. Well, the romance was perhaps too contrived, in the sense that I just don't accept that Jack could have moved so effortlessly from steerage to first class. (I know he was invited the first time; but he seems to keep getting into first class without being stopped until he's been there for a while.) The realities of the separation of the social classes were much more realistically portrayed, I thought, when the steerage passengers were going to be left locked down there after the ship hit the iceberg while the first class folks got to enjoy half empty lifeboats.A minor quibble, though. This is truly an excellent movie. My only regret is not seeing it in the theatre, where I think it would have been so much more impressive.9/10.",avoid watch film longest time long even releas dismiss overhyp overblown overli romantic piec hollywood schmaltz want noth never watch theatr shook head disbelief academi award even though never seen ask judg high school public speak contest one girl spoke movi great said realli felt like ship nonsens thought share feel fellow judg one look said might right like movi much mayb shell want learn real titan movi must done someth right get interest well mayb thought final appear pay tv ok thought ill give look see didnt want like didnt love great moviewher start first direct high school public speak contest right jame cameron superb job creat almost type atmospher gaieti life aboard eleg ship world nonchal news iceberg first spread rise sen panic dont watch realli feel perform lead perform kate winslet rose leonardo dicaprio jack excel winslet superior thought good rich girlpoor boy charact perfect thought opinion though steal show franc fisher rose mother perfect snobbi aristocrat could feel fear loath felt everi time look jack detail im expert sink titan reason gener knowledg film super job recreat histor detail accur weav seamlessli around fiction romanc impress inde song watch movi taken celin dion perform heart goe onproblem well romanc perhap contriv sen dont accept jack could move effortlessli steerag first class know invit first time seem keep get first class without stop he realiti separ social class much realist portray thought steerag passeng go left lock ship hit iceberg first class folk got enjoy half empti lifeboatsa minor quibbl though truli excel movi regret see theatr think would much impress,positive

5,"Titanic is one of my all time favourite films. I'm a 24 year old guy who has probably not cried in front of anyone since I was a kid, but this movie plays on my emotions more than almost any other. We all know the ship will sink (does that even qualify as a spoiler?) but the build-up to this event - the smugness and over- confidence, assurances of it being ""unsinkable"" - tease the audience, almost to the point where you're like 'is it really going to sink?'I thought the performances of everyone were magnificent: I cared about the characters and their lives on and beyond the ship. Taking the time to introduce everyone and weave their stories together was masterful, even beyond the main characters, like Fabrizio and Murdoch the First Officer and countless more. It was heartbreaking towards the end when you see the panic gradually set in, and it slowly descends into total chaos. You remember Jack telling Rose all the places he's going to take her to and you imagine their love- filled lives together. The Irish mother telling her children the fairytale, resigned to their fate. The violinists trying to maintain a spirit of composure amidst the carnage. And the music! Wow. I cried for all of this. And especially right at the end when you see the photos of Rose's life, knowing she's fulfilled her promise and survived, living a full life, probably never having met anyone she loved as much as Jack all those years ago.Visually pleasing in every way, dramatic, musically astounding, great acting and above all a fantastic story make this an undeniably iconic, enduring film. A romantic-drama unlike any other.

6,"Good Lord. This movie right here, it's a masterpiece. I am not exaggerating when I say this. Tonight was the first time I watched this. I watched some parts of it earlier, but I thought it would probably be boring, and that I had better things to do. Tonight I watched the whole thing with my grandmother. I was completely wrong on that. This was the best movie that I've ever seen, and probably ever will see in my entire life. Me and my grandmother were both in tears by the end of it. There were two scenes which made me cry: the part where the orchestra played ""Nearer, My God, to Thee"" and the end when all those perished on the Titanic applaud at the kiss of Rose and Jack. This movie was absolutely amazing and I would watch it over and over again.",good lord movi right masterpiec exagger say tonight first time watch watch part earlier thought would probabl bore better thing tonight watch whole thing grandmoth complet wrong best movi ive ever seen probabl ever see entir life grandmoth tear end two scene made cri part orchestra play nearer god thee end perish titan applaud kiss rose jack movi absolut amaz would watch,positive

8,"Since I was a teenager in 1997, I can say with some degree of confidence that Titanic was made for teenage girls. Almost all of my female friends of the time adored this movie and paid to see it multiple times in theaters, so I can see why it saw so much box office success. Also, there's no question that when the boat sinks, it's terrifyingly spectacular. However, the real downfall of this movie is the terribly corny dialogue. The script sounds like it was written by adolescents. Plus, the love story is overly melodramatic. I can see why Titanic made a splash, but I only really enjoy the last half.",sinc teenag say degre confid titan made teenag girl almost femal friend time ador movi paid see multipl time theater see saw much box offic success also there question boat sink terrifyingli spectacular howev real downfal movi terribl corni dialogu script sound like written adolesc plu love stori overli melodramat see titan made splash realli enjoy last half,positive
9,"The stage curtains open ...Not since the advent of the 1995 film, ""Braveheart"", have I ever been as enthralled or emotionally invested into a movie as I was with ""Titanic"". I knew going in, just from the trailer and word-of-mouth, it was going to be good, but I had no idea the ride I was in for when the lights dimmed in the theater that night. I have never understood (and still don't understand) the negative backlash that I've read/heard when it come to this epic film. Because, it is just that - epic in every way, shape or form.We follow along as a young wayfarer named Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) wins a ticket to board the Titanic in a game of chance. During its fateful voyage, he meets and falls for an upper-class girl named Rose (Kate Winslet). Under the thumb of her demanding fiance (Billy Zane) and her narrow-minded mother, Rose is introduced to a different side to life by Jack, and he helps her to find her own individuality and independence, alienating her from a life that she already despises. She must now decide if she'll choose to stay where she is, or leave and have a life with Jack - a decision that is further compounded when the mighty ship strikes an iceberg leading to the eye popping conclusion.What makes this film work is the love story. A lot of the negative reviews I've read complain because there is a love story. But, without it, this movie doesn't work. I am not interested in watching a biography about the Titanic, I want a good story - and this movie certainly delivers that. I was completely invested in Jack and Rose, and when the ship began to sink, I was with them both every step of the way.I highly recommend this movie at 10 stars out of 10. The event of the ship sinking alone was awe inspiring. You are right there in the scene. I could not take my eyes off the screen. The direction is tight, the special effects phenomenal, and the acting completely believable. DiCaprio and Winslet had perfect chemistry. I was affected and moved by ""Titanic"". And even knowing the outcome, I will happily get on board again and again.",stage curtain open sinc advent film braveheart ever enthral emot invest movi titan knew go trailer wordofmouth go good idea ride light dim theater night never understood still dont understand neg backlash ive readheard come epic film epic everi way shape formw follow along young wayfar name jack leonardo dicaprio win ticket board titan game chanc fate voyag meet fall upperclass girl name rose kate winslet thumb demand fianc billi zane narrowmind mother rose introduc differ side life jack help find individu independ alien life alreadi despis must decid shell choos stay leav life jack decis compound mighti ship strike iceberg lead eye pop conclusionwhat make film work love stori lot neg review ive read complain love stori without movi doesnt work interest watch biographi titan want good stori movi certainli deliv complet invest jack rose ship began sink everi step wayi highli recommend movi star event ship sink alon awe inspir right scene could take eye screen direct tight special effect phenomen act complet believ dicaprio winslet perfect chemistri affect move titan even know outcom happili get board,positive
10,"TitanicIn 1912, The Titanic was transporting 2,240 passengers to the United States. Four days later the ship hit an iceberg, only 706 people survived. Years later, in 1997, Cameron wrote, directed, and co-produced a movie based on these true events. It stars Kate Winslet, Leonardo DiCaprio, Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Bill Paxton, Gloria Stuart, and Victor Garber.This movie tells a story about two fictional characters, Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet). They are from too different social classes, Jack doesn't have a lot of money, where Rose's family is rich, along with her mom wanting her to marry into a wealthy family.The combination of practical affects, CGI, and set designs, made everything including the ship sinking look real. The water scenes were filmed in water tanks and made to look like the Atlantic Ocean, this is an impressive accomplishment of the crew.Winslet does a good job portraying someone who is carefree, yet doesn't like her life with her fiancé she's supposed to marry. DiCaprio plays a charming guy who teaches Rose that she can just be herself. Together, they make a convincing couple. Its obvious Jack loves Rose, due to the decisions he makes towards the end. Billy Zane gives a strong performance, as he makes the audience dislike him, because of how he mistreats Rose.

11,"Ah, yes, the film that propelled Leonardi DiCapro to super stardom, became the first film to gross $1 billion, and stayed on the top of the box office charts for 12 years (only to be kicked off the top by another James Cameron film, Avatar).It is said 'Titanic' is the film with the most continuity errors of all films. Despite this, though, the film was indeed a masterpiece. The sheer scale of the sets and entire production were simply mind blowing! The sinking of the Titanic was the greatest ship sinking scene EVER and was done with such meticulous detail that one would think they actually really sunk the ship. Off course, that was not the case, though, as it were all (very elaborate) sets, most of which were destroyed during the making of the film.Leonardo made for a very likable hero, quite frankly one a lot of guys can relate to. The young lovers were so different and yet so alike, and their love story was almost endearing. I must admit, the jumping backwards and forwards in time was a bit unnecessary and resulted in an overlong epic. They should only have told the 1912 story. Apart from that, the film was thrilling, exciting and fascinating in every sense of the word!",ah ye film propel leonardi dicapro super stardom becam first film gross billion stay top box offic chart year kick top anoth jame cameron film avatarit said titan film continu error film despit though film inde masterpiec sheer scale set entir product simpli mind blow sink titan greatest ship sink scene ever done meticul detail one would think actual realli sunk ship cours case though elabor set destroy make filmleonardo made likabl hero quit frankli one lot guy relat young lover differ yet alik love stori almost endear must admit jump backward forward time bit unnecessari result overlong epic told stori apart film thrill excit fascin everi sen word,positive
12,"An extraordinary interest still exists in Cameron's film, still argument rages over just how good it is. The timing of its release was significant, the obsession with the film might be explained as a form of pre millennial tension at the close of the most murderous century the human race has known, a century which began with such hope and optimism, and in which the Titanic was ironically such a proud symbol. 'A Night to remember' was released amid worries about the Bomb and the feeling that science was again out of control. 'Titanic' amid millennial jitters. The most discussed aspect is the script, there are lines in the film that are moronic, irritating, senseless and just plain dumb. Others were quoted from the U.S.Senate Enquiry, which proves how people then had a better command of language than we do. Why do Jack and Rose board at Southampton when they've come from Paris? Why doesn't the diamond fall out of Rose's pocket going down with a sinking ship? Why doesn't she find it in her pocket on the Carpathia before reaching New York? Why is it that you can be rude to the ship's owner, assault and abuse the staff, 'fly' from an offlimits bow, run through boiler rooms and cargo holds, cause two stewards looking for you to drown, distract the lookouts, climb in and out of lifeboats, damage property, and NEVER get into trouble? Why do the steerage accept rich snooty first class gatecrashing their party? Why, why, why?Too much time is spent on the wrapping footage, though the unseen sunken interiors are breathtaking. The taste of showing the Titanic sinking like a computer game in front of a survivor isn't questioned. The dissolve of the wreck into the pristine ship packs an emotional wallop every time. Winslet isn't a great actress, she plays the same in every film. On Leo, when Titanic leaves port in a classic series of images, we feel his joy. But it's downhill from here.The engine room montage is another classic, but it's looking artificial. Murdoch's feet are all over the deck. The ship looks like it's populated by the Thunderbirds.Relief, Victor Garber arrives as Thomas Andrews and gives the dialogue meaning, conviction, dignity and charm, quite a feat since thanks to Cameron's warped priorities he only speaks two lines. A thing apparent in Rose is how lacking in charm she is, lighting up at table, and indelicate. No Edwardian. And as this film isn't subtle, but whacks you on the head and biffs you in the stomach we must have the class speech straight away. Tommy Ryan is the most irritating character I've seen on screen and completely unlike any Irish I've met. The next situation isn't credible. Isn't there a better way of introducing these two than the unbelievable jumping off the stern. There is one good line in the dull walk and talk that a first class wench would have said 'This is MY part of the ship' huffs Rose. But with the spit scene any hopes of a romantic wallow are dead.The cheek of the dinner party is how Jack Dawson, somebody who if Rose had chopped his hand off with the axe, would have been pushed to earn a living, has the temerity to lecture a brilliant engineer, a captain with 40 years experience and captains of industry on how to live life, when he hasn't started shaving himself. We need a unmaterialistic message in films, even if it would come better from a director who hadn't overspent his budget by $100million. But the portrayal of rich and poor is straight out of a propaganda film for the gulag.It's a pity, there is such a brilliant Irish band on board, and there aren't equally brilliant dancers.Whether the film has a Christian message at the core or if it's proclaiming that doing your own thing is more important, it's hard to say. The divine service was open to all classes so Jack being turned away is misleading and pointless. A stunning scene on the bow but there hasn't been a romantic exchange yet between this couple that convinces us. Such models of taste and discernment and the brightest thing they say about Monet is that his use of colour is extraordinary. The funniest line in film history: 'This is a ship, only so many places she could be'. The next shot: Titanic bowling merrily along. A thousand rooms!The iceberg finally turns up, the collision is breathtaking, the acting top notch and inseparable from the historical event even if Titanic hits the only iceberg in the whole Atlantic. The surreal party with music and lifejackets shows Cameron can write. Sometimes. But Jack manacled up is tedious and the crew wouldn't have done that on a sinking ship. The real story is lost in Rose running around. The lifeboats when we see them are done far better than any other version, and the timeline makes perfect sense.Titanic alone and helpless, a tiny ship with a futile rocket in an empty ocean is inspired. The film takes on a different dimension and has a touch of the sublime. The images that accompany the hymn are elegiac and perfect. The choreography around the last two boats can't be surpassed. Now we do feel a sense of the panic and despair. The water through the dome, a baptism of fire. No one can fail to be moved by the 20 minutes of terrible destruction. The lifeboat scenes couldn't have been done better, and the Carpathia is a painting brought to life. How exactly Rose retains her incognito through the years when she's a publicized actress, an aviator and everything else in the known universe isn't explained. The ending is a straight pinch from 'Somewhere in time' which did a better job of a love story set in 1912. The frustrating thing is how many things ARE done well. There are gems of writing and acting. It looks terrific. But it proves that you can recreate the cutlery, carpets, staterooms, clothes, but it's so much harder to recreate history. It isn't 1912. And half the film isn't Titanic.",extraordinari interest still exist cameron film still argument rage good time releas signific ob film might explain form pre millenni tension close murder centuri human race known centuri began hope optim titan iron proud symbol night rememb releas amid worri bomb feel scienc control titan amid millenni jitter discus aspect script line film moron irrit senseless plain dumb other quot ussen enquiri prove peopl better command languag jack rose board southampton theyv come pari doesnt diamond fall rose pocket go sink ship doesnt find pocket carpathia reach new york rude ship owner assault abus staff fli offlimit bow run boiler room cargo hold caus two steward look drown distract lookout climb lifeboat damag properti never get troubl steerag accept rich snooti first class gatecrash parti whytoo much time spent wrap footag though unseen sunken interior breathtak tast show titan sink like comput game front survivor isnt question dissolv wreck pristin ship pack emot wallop everi time winslet isnt great actress play everi film leo titan leav port classic seri imag feel joy downhil hereth engin room montag anoth classic look artifici murdoch foot deck ship look like popul thunderbirdsrelief victor garber arriv thoma andrew give dialogu mean convict digniti charm quit feat sinc thank cameron warp prioriti speak two line thing appar rose lack charm light tabl indel edwardian film isnt subtl whack head biff stomach must class speech straight away tommi ryan irrit charact ive seen screen complet unlik irish ive met next situat isnt credibl isnt better way introduc two unbeliev jump stern one good line dull walk talk first class wench would said part ship huff rose spit scene hope romant wallow deadth cheek dinner parti jack dawson somebodi rose chop hand axe would push earn live temer lectur brilliant engin captain year experi captain industri live life hasnt start shave need unmaterialist messag film even would come better director hadnt oversp budget million portray rich poor straight propaganda film gulagit piti brilliant irish band board arent equal brilliant dancerswheth film christian messag core proclaim thing import hard say divin servic open class jack turn away mislead pointless stun scene bow hasnt romant exchang yet coupl convinc u model tast discern brightest thing say monet use colour extraordinari funniest line film histori ship mani place could next shot titan bowl merrili along thousand roomsth iceberg final turn collis breathtak act top notch insepar histor event even titan hit iceberg whole atlant surreal parti music lifejacket show cameron write sometim jack manacl tediou crew wouldnt done sink ship real stori lost rose run around lifeboat see done far better version timelin make perfect sensetitan alon helpless tini ship futil rocket empti ocean inspir film take differ dimens touch sublim imag accompani hymn elegiac perfect choreographi around last two boat cant surpass feel sen panic despair water dome baptism fire one fail move minut terribl destruct lifeboat scene couldnt done better carpathia paint brought life exactli rose retain incognito year she public actress aviat everyth el known univers isnt explain end straight pinch somewher time better job love stori set frustrat thing mani thing done well gem write act look terrif prove recreat cutleri carpet stateroom cloth much harder recreat histori isnt half film isnt titan,positive

Jack and Rose's love story is so full of life and heart and what true love should be even if it's a battle or your not the same class and can't be together ounce you find your soulmate that's what love is about. Their characters felt so human and that really is what puts this movie at a whole new level. The camerawork is some of the best I have ever seen in any film. I don't even want to spoil how thrilling, chilling, beautifully well done the Titanic sinking part of the film is because it is something you just have to see for yourself and experience the devastating heartbreaking tragedy that occurred.

16,"Back in 1997, do I remember that year: Clinton bans cloning research, the unfortunate death of Princess Diana, the Marlins won the world series and a woman gave birth to septuplets. This was also the big year in the release of Titanic, one of the biggest films of all time: a tale about the ship of dreams, about a boy and a girl who fall in love but are torn apart by their social class and at the height of their emotional commitment the ship meets with disaster. I don't think anybody could have expected Titanic to be as HUGE as it was, the movie was bigger than life and had millions of fans, 85% of them being teenage girls, I was 12 years old at the time, and of course saw the movie multiple times. It was the film that made me believe that the love that Jack and Rose shared was so real and beautiful. At the time I felt that Titanic could do no wrong, of course I grew up and didn't watch the film since I was 14, a couple years ago I saw the film on DVD for 5.99 and figured that it was a good price and to see what I thought about the movie now. Was it worth the hype? Was it really the best movie of all time? Was that Leonardo's real nose? OK, I know that's silly to say, but I did re-watch the film. Being completely honest here, Titanic is a great movie, it delivered in romance, humor, disaster, emotions and took us on this incredible maiden voyage.The film starts with Brock Lovett and his team exploring the wreck of the RMS Titanic, searching for a necklace set with a valuable blue diamond called the Heart of the Ocean. Unsuccessful, they instead discover a drawing of a young woman wearing the Heart of the Ocean, dated the day the Titanic sank. 101-year-old Rose Dawson Calvert learns of the drawing, and contacts Lovett to inform him she is the woman in the drawing. When asked if she knew the whereabouts of the necklace, Rose Calvert recalls her memories aboard the Titanic, revealing for the first time that she was Rose DeWitt Bukater. In 1912, the upper-class 17-year-old Rose boards the ship with her controlling fiancé, Cal Hockley and her desperate for money mother, Ruth DeWitt Bukater. Distraught and frustrated by her engagement, Rose attempts suicide by jumping from the stern. Before she leaps, a drifter and artist named Jack Dawson intervenes who convinces her not to jump. Jack and Rose strike up a tentative friendship as she thanks him for saving her life, and he shares stories of his adventures traveling and sketching; their bond deepens when they leave a first-class formal dinner of the wealthy for a much livelier gathering of dancing, music and beer in third-class. After revealing their love for each other and wish to leave together when the ship docks, they then witness the ship's fatal collision with an iceberg and now must escape together.So does Titanic live up to it's hype? I still say that this is a great movie to watch, I think that there were and still are quite a few haters that for some reason just want to trash the movie because it had won a ton of awards and Leo Mania was born at the time. Everyone is entitled to an opinion, but please don't let the haters bother you from watching this great movie. It has great acting, amazing effects, beautiful costumes, outstanding sets, a well-written story and still looks flawless. Love it or hate it, you have to admit this movie didn't get a lot of hype just because of Leo's baby face or Kate's amazing ability to cry on sight, this film is something special. Otherwise I don't think we'd still be talking about it so many years later. Kate and Leo had this amazing chemistry that in my opinion made it one of the greatest love stories of all time. Despite the story not being the most original with the rich girl loves poor boy plot, I think it worked extremely well because they fit so well together. James Cameron, the extreme perfectionist that he is, went over time and money budgets for Titanic, but this was his baby and it paid off very well. James had captured everything about Titanic and the sinking so well. He respectfully shows what terror the victims went through that night and made sure that this wasn't just a love story but to remember those who lost their lives on the tragic voyage. He had every right in my opinion to scream ""I'm king of the world!"" at the Oscars, because this movie blew everyone out of the water(no pun intended), you know what? I'm going to admit it, I love Titanic, even past my teen years I absolutely adore this movie, it will always hold a special place in my heart, it has too since I saw this film 8 times in the theater when it was released. Remember one thing, be true to yourself, don't follow the crowd, lovers or haters, if you go with the hype you're always going to go crazy over a film before viewing it, then if you thought the film was just alright for some reason it comes off as the worst movie ever. I do recommend Titanic, it's a great one and sure to go down in the classics one day.10/10",back rememb year clinton ban clone research unfortun death princess diana marlin world seri woman gave birth septuplet also big year releas titan one biggest film time tale ship dream boy girl fall love torn apart social class height emot commit ship meet disast dont think anybodi could expect titan huge movi bigger life million fan teenag girl year old time cours saw movi multipl time film made believ love jack rose share real beauti time felt titan could wrong cours grew didnt watch film sinc coupl year ago saw film dvd figur good price see thought movi worth hype realli best movi time leonardo real nose ok know that silli say rewatch film complet honest titan great movi deliv romanc humor disast emot took u incred maiden voyageth film start brock lovett team explor wreck rm titan search necklac set valuabl blue diamond call heart ocean unsuccess instead discov draw young woman wear heart ocean date day titan sank yearold rose dawson calvert learn draw contact lovett inform woman draw ask knew whereabout necklac rose calvert recal memori aboard titan reveal first time rose dewitt bukat upperclass yearold rose board ship control fianc cal hockley desper money mother ruth dewitt bukat distraught frustrat engag rose attempt suicid jump stern leap drifter artist name jack dawson interven convinc jump jack rose strike tent friendship thank save life share stori adventur travel sketch bond deepen leav firstclass formal dinner wealthi much liveli gather danc music beer thirdclass reveal love wish leav togeth ship dock wit ship fatal collis iceberg must escap togetherso titan live hype still say great movi watch think still quit hater reason want trash movi ton award leo mania born time everyon entitl opinion plea dont let hater bother watch great movi great act amaz effect beauti costum outstand set wellwritten stori still look flawless love hate admit movi didnt get lot hype leo babi face kate amaz abil cri sight film someth special otherwis dont think wed still talk mani year later kate leo amaz chemistri opinion made one greatest love stori time despit stori origin rich girl love poor boy plot think work extrem well fit well togeth jame cameron extrem perfectionist went time money budget titan babi paid well jame captur everyth titan sink well respect show terror victim went night made sure wasnt love stori rememb lost live tragic voyag everi right opinion scream im king world oscar movi blew everyon waterno pun intend know im go admit love titan even past teen year absolut ador movi alway hold special place heart sinc saw film time theater releas rememb one thing true dont follow crowd lover hater go hype your alway go go crazi film view thought film alright reason come worst movi ever recommend titan great one sure go classic one day,positive
17,"Watching 'Titanic' was like having 2 people wrestle with a remote channel changer. Just when the movie becomes (historically) interesting, the other person grabs the remote and switches it to a pedestrian daytime soap opera. Did Kate have to be on hand at every step that led to the sinking? (her and Leo are on the side of the deck where the ice hits, of course, JUST missing them; OH! let's put her next to the Captain when he learns Titanic's fate and lack of life boats). The tragedy was story enough and James Cameron did a brilliant business decision to shove a pre-teen love opera to the foreground so girls could flock to the theater over and over to see Leo alive again and again and again...! Give the channel changer back so we can please continue with the story of the ship. Yes, I heard some crying when Leo sank into the abyss...But no sniveling when the little boy (who Leo tries to rescue before the boy is grabbed away from his panicky father) is swept away by the flooded corridor. So much for crying priorities!!I'm a big Cameron fan! Titanic has left him permanently wealthy. And he's tapped into a genre the same way Lucas tapped with Star Wars in attracting a select category of people that were willing to see this over and over (Titanic's billion dollar revenue was the result of many repeat viewings worldwide combining history with poster boy imagery).Special effects were brilliant! But I'll take the 1958 black and white ""A Night To Remember"" movie instead.Today's lesson: If you're going to use an ax to free someone shackled with chains, don't aim, close your eyes tight, THEN swing hard so you won't see the spraying blood.

18,"Every once in a while the conversation will turn to ""favorite movies."" I'll mention Titanic, and at least a couple people will snicker. I pay them no mind because I know that five years ago, these same people were moved to tears by that very movie. And they're too embarrassed now to admit it.I just rewatched Titanic for the first time in a long time. Expecting to simply enjoy the story again, I was surprised to find that the movie has lost none of its power over these five years. I cried again.... in all the same places. It brought me back to 1997 when I can remember how a movie that no one thought would break even became the most popular movie of all time. A movie that burst into the public consciousness like no other movie I can recall (yes, even more than Star Wars). And today, many people won't even admit they enjoyed it. Folks, let's get something straight -- you don't look cool when you badmouth this film. You look like an out of touch cynic.No movie is perfect and this one has a few faults. Some of the dialogue falls flat, and some of the plot surrounding the two lovers comes together a little too neatly. However, none of this is so distracting that it ruins the film.Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are wonderful. Leo is one of the fine actors of his generation. Wait 'til you see him in Gangs of New York before you call him nothing more than a pretty boy. Kate Winslet was so strong in this film. The movie really was hers, and she held it together beautifully.James Cameron managed what many believed was impossible by recreating a completely believable Titanic. The sinking scenes were horrific, just as they were that night. How anyone can say the effects were bad is beyond me. I was utterly transfixed.This film is one memorable scene after another. Titanic leaving port in Southampton. Rose and Jack at the bow, ""flying"". ""Iceberg, right ahead!"" The screws hanging unbelievably out of the ocean. The screams of the doomed after she went down. And that ending that brought even the burliest man in the theater to tears.The music, which has also been a victim of the film's success, was a key ingredient. James Horner's score was simply perfect. And the love theme was beautiful and tragic. Too bad Celine Dion's pop song version had to destroy this great bit of music for so many.I confess, I am a Titanic buff. As such, I relished the opportunity to see the ship as we never got to see it -- in all its beauty. Perhaps watching it sink affected me more than some because I've had such an interest in the ship all my life. However, I doubt many of those I saw crying were Titanic buffs. I applaud Cameron for bringing this story to the masses in a way that never demeaned the tragedy. The film was made with such humanity.Another reviewer said it better than I ever could: Open up your hearts to Titanic, and you will not be disappointed.",everi convers turn favorit movi ill mention titan least coupl peopl snicker pay mind know five year ago peopl move tear movi theyr embarrass admit iti rewatch titan first time long time expect simpli enjoy stori surpris find movi lost none power five year cri place brought back rememb movi one thought would break even becam popular movi time movi burst public conscious like movi recal ye even star war today mani peopl wont even admit enjoy folk let get someth straight dont look cool badmouth film look like touch cynicno movi perfect one fault dialogu fall flat plot surround two lover come togeth littl neatli howev none distract ruin filmleonardo dicaprio kate winslet wonder leo one fine actor gener wait til see gang new york call noth pretti boy kate winslet strong film movi realli held togeth beautifullyjam cameron manag mani believ imposs recreat complet believ titan sink scene horrif night anyon say effect bad beyond utterli transfixedthi film one memor scene anoth titan leav port southampton rose jack bow fli iceberg right ahead screw hang unbeliev ocean scream doom went end brought even burliest man theater tearsth music also victim film success key ingredi jame horner score simpli perfect love theme beauti tragic bad celin dion pop song version destroy great bit music manyi confess titan buff relish opportun see ship never got see beauti perhap watch sink affect ive interest ship life howev doubt mani saw cri titan buff applaud cameron bring stori mass way never demean tragedi film made humanityanoth review said better ever could open heart titan disappoint,positive

21,"Sure, Titanic was a good movie, the first time you see it, but you really should see it a second time and your opinion of the film will definetly change. The first time you see the movie you see the underlying love-story and think: ooh, how romantic. The second time (and I am not the only one to think this) it is just annoying and you just sit there watching the movie thinking, When is this d**n ship going to sink??? And even this is not as impressive when you see it several times. The acting in this film is not bad, but definetly not great either. Was I glad DiCaprio did not win an oscar for that film, I mean who does he think he is, Anthony Hopkins or Denzel Washington? He does 1 half-good movie and won't do a film for less than $20 million. And then everyone is suprised that there are hardly any films with him in it. But enough about, in my eyes, the worst character of the film. Kate Winslet's performance on the other hand was wonderful. I also tink that the director is very talented to put a film of such a magnitude together. There is one lesson to be learned about this movie: there are too many love-stories as it is, filmmakers shouldn't try to add a crummy romance in to every single movie!!!

23,"Titanic is a true masterpiece and is easily one of the greatest films in history. James Cameron has outdone himself with this epic film that is clearly one for the ages. It is perfect in almost every way and can be watched over and over again. From the directing, beautiful photography and an immortal song by Celine Dion. Not only is a masterful depiction of the sinking of the Titanic but a great love story. Romance is my lowest rated genre so it takes a really well made love story for me to like it and Titanic showcased this. Worthy of all its Oscars and revenue this film has etched itself as one of the great triumphs of cinema.

26,"C+ The best grossing film of all time, until recently that is, but is it really the best film ever? Even worthy of getting all that money? Upon initial viewing, many probably thought so, but I'm not one of those. It does have its strong suits, and James Cameron has rarely, if ever, failed me. This film stands out as quite different in tone contrast to say ""Aliens', ""T2', or even ""Avatar"". Note the first two, f*CK Avatar, use low-key lighting, while this film is just so bright all the time. The performances are grade A in this film. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are great throughout , and the end sequence was of course astonishing and a leap forward in visual effects.My biggest problem with this movie? It over does a love story to the point it hits two hours or so, and then we get an hour more or less of epic disaster with tragedy and believable chaos. But the first two hours just seem to drag on, quite unnecessarily at that. Along with that, the score was dismal at best. Naturally the only scene to defy this was the ""last song"" instant as it sank. One of the main things that draws me to a film it its score, or sometimes a lack there of. Sappy romantic themes and an unfitting climax music as thousands drown. It just was distracting and honestly didn't belong there. Overall, ""Titanic"" is worth seeing and all, but far from being the best movie ever, or even close for that matter. This a movie where I definitely rent the DVD, practically fall sleep an hour or so in, then wake up and say ""what the? Still not yet?"", and then just use chapter selection to get to see the climax.",c best gross film time recent realli best film ever even worthi get money upon initi view mani probabl thought im one strong suit jame cameron rare ever fail film stand quit differ tone contrast say alien even avatar note first two fck avatar use lowkey light film bright time perform grade film leonardo dicaprio kate winslet great throughout end sequenc cours astonish leap forward visual effectsmi biggest problem movi love stori point hit two hour get hour le epic disast tragedi believ chao first two hour seem drag quit unnecessarili along score dismal best natur scene defi last song instant sank one main thing draw film score sometim lack sappi romant theme unfit climax music thousand drown distract honestli didnt belong overal titan worth see far best movi ever even close matter movi definit rent dvd practic fall sleep hour wake say still yet use chapter select get see climax,positive
27,"""Based on the tragedy that spawned thousands of heartbreaking true stories, comes this fake one."" It's time to decide: was it insensitive and somewhat cheap of James Cameron to throw two made-up passengers who fall in love onto the ship? Or did these two characters offer the audience an anchor to hold onto as we are guided through the dreadful events of April 15th, 1912? Without a doubt, the latter. The fictional story of Jack and Rose never distracts from the tragic true story, it cinematically enhances it. We never ever miss the bigger picture.First of all, just look at this film. The resplendent wonder of the film's set design, both interior and exterior, places you right on board. It looks and feels the part. And when the inevitable disaster strikes, Cameron grabs onto you and drags you through each painful moment in striking detail. The sinking of the Titanic is brought to life with exquisite attention to detail and astonishing visual effects. It makes for the greatest disaster scenes in any movie I've seen.However, a Roland Emmerich or Michael Bay film this is not, as Cameron never allows the spectacle to distract us from the agony of it. Watching the Titanic being destroyed is not fun or, in its broadest sense, exciting - it's intensely distressing. Unlike most disaster films, it never feels like we're watching a crowd of extras on a film set flailing around. The lead up to the iceberg strike engages you so convincingly in the period, such that each person in front of the camera has been imbued with rich character. And when the ship sinks, it genuinely shocks you to see them go. For a good part of the sinking, Jack and Rose's fictional plight is quite sensibly placed to one side, giving us time to reflect on the truth and how it would have felt to be aboard the ship that horrifying night.So aside from its sweeping spectacle and moving depiction of real-life tragedy, what does the story of Jack and Rose bring to the table? In spite of how persuasive the film is, one must remember - it's ultimately a work of fiction, not a documentary. Like any period drama, it is an interpretation of how society worked at the time. Jack and Rose, as well as being beautifully played by DiCaprio and Winslet, are incredibly well crafted. They are a window into a much more subtle form of racism, which is still prevalent today. It's called class, and in the latter half of the movie, it becomes a tool with which to decide who lives and who dies.Titanic has pretty much anything you can ask for. It's a romance; it's a disaster movie; it's an action film; it's got a sense of humour and wit; it's a period drama; it's a tragedy. Summed up, Titanic is about as perfect a cinematic experience as you're ever likely to get.",base tragedi spawn thousand heartbreak true stori come fake one time decid insensit somewhat cheap jame cameron throw two madeup passeng fall love onto ship two charact offer audienc anchor hold onto guid dread event april th without doubt latter fiction stori jack rose never distract tragic true stori cinemat enhanc never ever miss bigger picturefirst look film resplend wonder film set design interior exterior place right board look feel part inevit disast strike cameron grab onto drag pain moment strike detail sink titan brought life exquisit attent detail astonish visual effect make greatest disast scene movi ive seenhowev roland emmerich michael bay film cameron never allow spectacl distract u agoni watch titan destroy fun broadest sen excit intens distress unlik disast film never feel like watch crowd extra film set flail around lead iceberg strike engag convincingli period person front camera imbu rich charact ship sink genuin shock see go good part sink jack rose fiction plight quit sensibl place one side give u time reflect truth would felt aboard ship horrifi nightso asid sweep spectacl move depict reallif tragedi stori jack rose bring tabl spite persuas film one must rememb ultim work fiction documentari like period drama interpret societi work time jack rose well beauti play dicaprio winslet incred well craft window much subtl form racism still preval today call class latter half movi becom tool decid live diestitan pretti much anyth ask romanc disast movi action film got sen humour wit period drama tragedi sum titan perfect cinemat experi your ever like get,positive

30,"I first saw ""Titanic"" in fairly early 1998, I think, here in Australia. I went with a girl I had recently got to know on the Internet. She had already seen it, and spoke in raptures about it after we left the cinema, while I was hesitating somewhat, as I was not sure about what I had just witnessed. Since then, I have seen the film at least twice more, including just now, and I stick by my opinion that I have never seen a movie that is so bad and so good at the same time. The bad, as so many people have said, is the script. Well, the characters too. The main romance is so embarrassingly contrived as to be juvenile, and this is not helped by the character of Rose. Quite frankly, I can't stand her, and can only wonder why Jack did not push the little brat off the ship when he had the chance. Speaking of Jack, I liked him. He and Molly Brown were, by far, the two best characters shown. I'm not bagging the acting of Winslett. I think she did well. I just thought her character was loathsome. Not much better is Cal. I couldn't stand him either, and yes, I know you're not meant to like him, but I didn't like the way I didn't like him! Talk about a corny villain. Snobby, cowardly... by the time he picked up the child to get his way off the ship, I was thinking, ""Alright, we get the idea. He's a creep."" Really, I thought the whole ""first class and the rest"" concept was overdone. Yes, I know it was an issue, but it's so clumsy and obvious as to be cringe worthy. But probably the worst and most disappointing character was the captain. Here was someone I would have loved to got to know. Ultimately, the sinking was all his fault. Yet there was no depth to him, instead just coming off as a feeble human being who did and said little, and who looked (understandably) more and more desolate as he saw what was happening. But then there is the good. The sinking. Absolutely incredible. I am always fascinated by the fact that the ship started to sink but, as is the nature of such events, everything looks normal for a while. People moved around as usual, the ship just kept motoring along. And yet we knew it would be under water in a couple of hours. The gradual submersion is enthralling, and technically brilliant. This is why I like to come back to the film, and no it's not because I'm a disaster fan (which I am) who just wants to see people die and not care about things like romance. Not at all. Really, no. A key to such films is depth of character and their relationships with each other. No real people means no emotional charge when said disaster happens. The effects are breathtaking, and the model work stunning. I can't enthuse enough about this part of the film.But the bad comes close to killing it all, and my view does not change after each time I see it. ""Titanic"" polarises me like no other film I've ever seen. It is awful. It is tremendous. Ultimately, the mixture makes it a middling film at best, which is a great shame. How it won Best Picture at the Oscars remains one of the biggest jokes in cinema history. But maybe, if we can forget about the bad, we can revel in the good, and appreciate some of the most stunning moments ever filmed in Hollywood.",first saw titan fairli earli think australia went girl recent got know internet alreadi seen spoke raptur left cinema hesit somewhat sure wit sinc seen film least twice includ stick opinion never seen movi bad good time bad mani peopl said script well charact main romanc embarrassingli contriv juvenil help charact rose quit frankli cant stand wonder jack push littl brat ship chanc speak jack like molli brown far two best charact shown im bag act winslett think well thought charact loathsom much better cal couldnt stand either ye know your meant like didnt like way didnt like talk corni villain snobbi cowardli time pick child get way ship think alright get idea he creep realli thought whole first class rest concept overdon ye know issu clumsi obviou cring worthi probabl worst disappoint charact captain someon would love got know ultim sink fault yet depth instead come feebl human said littl look understand desol saw happen good sink absolut incred alway fascin fact ship start sink natur event everyth look normal peopl move around usual ship kept motor along yet knew would water coupl hour gradual submers enthral technic brilliant like come back film im disast fan want see peopl die care thing like romanc realli key film depth charact relationship real peopl mean emot charg said disast happen effect breathtak model work stun cant enthus enough part filmbut bad come close kill view chang time see titan polaris like film ive ever seen aw tremend ultim mixtur make middl film best great shame best pictur oscar remain one biggest joke cinema histori mayb forget bad revel good appreci stun moment ever film hollywood,positive

32,"I wake up in the middle of the night with total anxiety.While the fictional story line is fairly cliche and some of the characters are a little cringe (Bill Paxton's hair and earring, for example), the truth is this: 1,517 people died horrible deaths in the icy Atlantic in the dead of night. That eats at me constantly. I think of some of them being all cozy in their beds, happily dreaming of going to America, and suddenly they are waken by the rumbling of the iceberg hit, by the alarms, by the sounds of rising panic and the unbelievably coldness of the weather and water. It saddens me to this day.I caught the movie yet again while channel surfing and sure enough, I stopped and ended up watching the last 90 minutes. The recreation of the sinking is amazing and horrifying. The details presented put you right there. I always put myself in that situation mentally and I wonder what would have become of me. No one can truly know until it actually happens. I think about the cold more than anything. I have been in very cold places before, but never getting soaking wet in that cold. The people who ended up alive in the water went through a horrible hell for a few minutes then hypothermia drifted them off to their deaths. It's haunting to think about. I woke up around 3am after having a dream I was in icy water, trying to catch my breath, trying to stay afloat, and not doing very well at either.

33,"Firstly and foremostly, I am a guy, which (in most cases) means I did not go see Titanic to see DiCaprio...although I think he can be a great actor.  Reading through earlier comments, i grew a bit weary of hearing about lame script and shallow characters.  I went to see a ship sink...the plot and the characters were, at least to me, a kind of icing on the Cake.  I actually think a lot of the characters were done well; that is, by the time they die in freezing water, you actually felt a tinge of sadness for them.  But , by the time Titanic was over, I was sufficiently moved to make me tell people that it was a great movie.  Kate Winslet was good, Kathy Bates was perfect, Leo was ok (I'll give you people that - I've seen him shine like I know he can ... Basketball Diaries, Romeo & Juliet).  But ultimately, the Titanic sinks...and it was absolutely stunning.  Bravo to Cameron.  He didn't just show us a large ship sinking, he showed us the back half of it crashing down on a hundred freezing, drowning people; he showed us a third class mother attempting to sing her children to sleep because she knew they were all doomed (broke my heart - i cried the most right there at that point), he showed people who worked extremely hard to get OUT of the bowels of the ship only to be sucked back in when a random window shattered and the water carried them on back in...detail.

35,"Titanic is one of my favorite movies, and it is a timeless classic that did not receive the acclaim and respect it deserved. I know that it got Oscar nominations, and it received the hype, but its not even in the top 250 which is very disappointing, because Titanic is as least as good if not better than many of the movies in the top 250. It is unfortunate that it was unpopular among so many people. During its day it was the highest grossing film of all time. Unfortunately the success and hype of the movie have spawned vicious criticism. A lot of viewers love Titanic, but many more bash the film and dissect it for problems such as its ""lack of originality"", ""weak script"", and ""poor acting"", all of which are overly critical and not true. Maybe the script could have been a little better, but it was good enough for me. It may have been simple, but it was still well-written in my opinion. I don't know why everyone say's the acting is bad, I thought all of the cast did very well in this movie. As for the originality, its not the first love story to be told, but in my opinion it is the most believable, epic, and heart-wrenching love story to ever be depicted in a movie. The love the two characters have for each other is totally convincing.Titanic does use a historical setting to set the foundation for the movie, but so do a lot of other great movies. A lot of people say they don't like Titanic because it was too long, but I don't think the movie's length is a problem because it's so good that it's worth the 3 hour commitment. Sure, it could have been a little shorter, but I don't know that it would have been made that much of an improvement. Titanic is indeed a very lengthy film, but the movie is breath-taking because of its strong plot, gorgeous cinematography, phenomenal special effects, and superb acting. A lot of people don't like Leonardo Di Caprio in this movie. In fact, many of the people who didn't like this movie blame Di Caprio. Leonardo Di Caprio is not really respected as an actor but often dismissed as a ""pretty boy"". Leonardo Di Caprio is not the greatest actor ever, but he did a good job in this movie, and I find the attacks on his acting to be unfair. In my opinion he did his best work in this movie.Kate Winslet is perfect in Titanic. She is a very gifted actress who is part of what makes this movie so good. But she didn't do it alone: The chemistry between her character and Leonardo Di Caprio's character is so natural, that it does not seem like they acting at all. Kate Winslet plays a young woman from a rich family named Rose, and Leonardo Di Caprio plays a poor artist named Jack. The two meet on the voyage of the Titanic and fall in love. But Rose is strongly encouraged to marry a rich man named Cal Hockley. Rose's family and Cal disapprove of Jack. Throughout the movie Rose and Jack's relationship develops, much to Cal's dismay. Cal becomes the enemy of both Rose and Jack. He hires a man to capture Jack.A real ocean liner was built for the production of this movie. It is not quite as big as the real Titanic but it is close to it. The replica of the ship looks very authentic, it looks just like the real ship. Titanic may start off a little slow, but it is still very engrossing, in my opinion. The second half of the movie is unforgettable. It is tense, suspenseful, and compelling. Watching this movie makes you feel like you were really on the ship. The movie does include some characters that really were on the ship, but Jack and Rose's characters are fictitious. I'm not sure how accurate the rest of the movie is, but the reality of it all is impeccable. Titanic is a riveting movie that really draws you in to the disaster and the tragedy of that night.I would certainly recommend Titanic, to all audiences. Do not listen the hype though, and do not listen to the criticism either. Just watch the movie, and make your own opinion. If you leave your cynicism at the door, then you may just discover the beauty of this movie.",titan one favorit movi timeless classic receiv acclaim respect deserv know got oscar nomin receiv hype even top disappoint titan least good better mani movi top unfortun unpopular among mani peopl day highest gross film time unfortun success hype movi spawn viciou critic lot viewer love titan mani bash film dissect problem lack origin weak script poor act overli critic true mayb script could littl better good enough may simpl still wellwritten opinion dont know everyon say act bad thought cast well movi origin first love stori told opinion believ epic heartwrench love stori ever depict movi love two charact total convincingtitan use histor set set foundat movi lot great movi lot peopl say dont like titan long dont think movi length problem good worth hour commit sure could littl shorter dont know would made much improv titan inde lengthi film movi breathtak strong plot gorgeou cinematographi phenomen special effect superb act lot peopl dont like leonardo di caprio movi fact mani peopl didnt like movi blame di caprio leonardo di caprio realli respect actor often dismiss pretti boy leonardo di caprio greatest actor ever good job movi find attack act unfair opinion best work moviek winslet perfect titan gift actress part make movi good didnt alon chemistri charact leonardo di caprio charact natur seem like act kate winslet play young woman rich famili name rose leonardo di caprio play poor artist name jack two meet voyag titan fall love rose strongli encourag marri rich man name cal hockley rose famili cal disapprov jack throughout movi rose jack relationship develop much cal dismay cal becom enemi rose jack hire man captur jacka real ocean liner built product movi quit big real titan close replica ship look authent look like real ship titan may start littl slow still engross opinion second half movi unforgett ten suspens compel watch movi make feel like realli ship movi includ charact realli ship jack rose charact fictiti im sure accur rest movi realiti impecc titan rivet movi realli draw disast tragedi nighti would certainli recommend titan audienc listen hype though listen critic either watch movi make opinion leav cynic door may discov beauti movi,positive
36,"So I saw it as a child. And I didn't feel anything about it back then. Yes, a tragedy. Yes, a romantic story. But it all seemed to be pretty simple.I rewatched it multiple times as an adult. And I cried every time.First, yes, it's a romantic story and a tragedy. But it's not a common one. Because Rose and Jack are not as toxic as romantic couples usually are. And their love story has its reasons.Rose wants to get out of her life when she boards the ship. She is annoyed by her mother, she hates her groom, and she is a free soul from the very beginning.Jack is also free. He is an embodiment of freedom.So it makes a lot of sense that they fall in love.Their relationships evolve as the tragedy happens. Because Rose understands that she wants to be with him (= to be free) and she fights for it. She had a chance to run away but she didn't.And when the whole thing with the ship happens we see how tough and brave they both actually are. How much they want to survive.In a way, the movie ends with Rose getting her freedom. She is a changed person, she follows her dreams and Jack gave it to her in a way.Every shot of the movie is a masterpiece. The ship's orchestra moment, the old couple, the mother and her kids will probably haunt me forever.The movie is truly a masterpiece and I love it.",saw child didnt feel anyth back ye tragedi ye romant stori seem pretti simplei rewatch multipl time adult cri everi timefirst ye romant stori tragedi common one rose jack toxic romant coupl usual love stori reasonsros want get life board ship annoy mother hate groom free soul beginningjack also free embodi freedomso make lot sen fall lovetheir relationship evolv tragedi happen rose understand want free fight chanc run away didntand whole thing ship happen see tough brave actual much want survivein way movi end rose get freedom chang person follow dream jack gave wayeveri shot movi masterpiec ship orchestra moment old coupl mother kid probabl haunt foreverth movi truli masterpiec love,positive
37,"Let's get one thing straight before we embark on this perilous journey into Hollywood History: the only ""truth"" in this movie is that the RMS Titanic did sink in April 1912 and that Leonardo DiCaprio is prettier than Kate Winslet. Everything else in James Cameron's *Titanic* is marshmallow fancy.Movie opens in the modern Atlantic, with a Titanic salvage crew helmed by amiable Brock Lovett (sun-weathered Bill Paxton), who haul surfaceward some intriguing artifacts. 84-year-old Rose (Gloria Stuart) claims she was a Titanic passenger, so is brought aboard Lovett's vessel to provide information.In a cheeky foreshadowing of the breath-hammering visuals to come, Lovett's crewmate outlines Titanic's death throes, aided by computer graphics (probably the selfsame graphics that the actual movie used as storyboard for its final visuals), before Lovett asks Rose for a firsthand account of the RMS Titanic and she, in a rheumy Percodan haze, starts relating a chick flick with Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet.And under the chick flick, the film's main premise - a story of White Pride, sautéed in eleven million gallons of seawater.Rose's narration is the anomaly that eats at this film's verisimilitude: though we humor her spinning her tale of irrelevant romantic rhetoric, when it comes to events outside her sphere of experience (such as private meetings between the captain and crew), she relates them as if omniscient (if we are to regard all the film's action aboard Titanic as her testimony). Even the iceberg impact is comprehensively covered from all angles (from the lookouts, to the bridge, to the engine room, captain and crowd) by Rose's ""flashback."" Not bad for someone who was backseat bonking her body-shaved boy-man at the time.Rose laments that she ""doesn't even have a picture of Jack,"" her steerage-class lover (Leonardo DiCaprio). Maybe that's why she remembers him as so staggeringly beautiful.It's a pity that writer-director Cameron leaned so heavily on the vapid love story as this movie's propeller, as the rest of the film is a chest-clenching stunner.The grandeur of the Royal Mail Ship Titanic is beautifully captured in its restored filmic incarnation. Costuming, characters and exterior shots are paid the utmost detail  although it must be said that, historically at least, DiCaprio's character (Jack) was probably treading a time period more acquainted with the use of recreational drugs with his yells of ""Woooo!"" from the ship's prow. His friend, Fabrizio (Danny Nucci), didn't help with the authenticity; supplied by a casting agency specializing in Ethnic Stereotypes, Nucci is about as Italian as a Domino's Pizza, sporting the absolute worst ""Movie Italian"" accent of all time  the exact same accent my friends and I would adopt in the schoolyard when we were ""pretending to be Italian."" Winning their tickets in a card game, Jack and Fabrizio are overjoyed even in their steerage quarters Whilst above the water line, onto the first class decks desultorily rambles Rose (Kate Winslet) with her demanding mother (Frances Fisher), stormy fiancé (Billy Zane) and luggage enough to kill three pack-elephants. Elbow-gloved and triple-corseted, she remarks via voice-over, ""To me it was a slave ship, taking me back to America in chains."" Try telling that to an African-American, honey, in your big feathery hat and frothy bloomers.Meeting Jack during a spoiled brat suicide attempt, Rose is drawn to his vagabond swagger and hairless torso, falling for idiot lines like, ""You've got a fire inside you and I'd hate to see it go out."" (George Lucas wrote that one.) The film world does not communicate ""smell."" The super-privileged have a way of ""deodorizing"" themselves that is wholly alien to the super-poor. Hence, no matter how much prettier Jack is than Rose, as soon as she stood downwind of his below-decks stench, the romance would have come to an earthy halt (retching optional).Instead, Jack is invited to sup with the pinky-raisers, where he blathers about his itinerant lifestyle as if it was a blessing; living the devil-may-care bum's life of cobbling his sustenance from whatever rat-brained scheme comes along, and literally not knowing ""where he'll be sleeping the next night"" may be a romantic notion if you are a successful writer or an independently wealthy traveler  but not if you are, in fact, a REAL BUM.An ocean liner has to sink before Rose lets go of this vagrant (whilst staying in Spoiled Byoch character by selfishly hogging the one floating plank in all of the Atlantic).A well-made, mind-numbing romance this cheesy usually scores low  but Cameron gained his points purely due to his magnificent boat-tipping.The climax of *Titanic* is a startling visualization of an historic event which no one alive on earth today saw first hand. Drawing from the latest forensic knowledge, combined with the physics of the process, Cameron places us directly on deck during his nightmare vision. We see the situation mount, from berg impact and apathy, to incredulity and ultimately panic, capturing the violent and colossal majesty of the ship breaking in half and pulling its aft section downwards vertically.The death throes of the RMS Titanic are astounding in their realism; we cannot help but compare the final scenes of *A Night To Remember*, with its wholly inaccurate, romantic portrayal of the doomed passengers aboard that black-and-white Titanic singing nobly together as their ship slipped away under them at a 45 degree angle. Not only is collective humanity never that level-headed, the physics of the sinking process was entirely ignored.With humanity onboard Cameron's boat ignobly screaming and selfishly grasping and punching and shooting and falling violently onto propeller blades, with smokestacks crushing passengers, decks splintering, cables whiplashing through foaming brine, and the final cataclysmic submersion at a vertiginous ninety-degree angle, Cameron's *Titanic* is  titanic!If even for a brief, awe-inspiring moment in time, it's good to be the King of the World.(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)",let get one thing straight embark peril journey hollywood histori truth movi rm titan sink april leonardo dicaprio prettier kate winslet everyth el jame cameron titan marshmallow fancymovi open modern atlant titan salvag crew helm amiabl brock lovett sunweath bill paxton haul surfaceward intrigu artifact yearold rose gloria stuart claim titan passeng brought aboard lovett vessel provid informationin cheeki foreshadow breathhamm visual come lovett crewmat outlin titan death throe aid comput graphic probabl selfsam graphic actual movi use storyboard final visual lovett ask rose firsthand account rm titan rheumi percodan haze start relat chick flick leonardo dicaprio kate winsletand chick flick film main premis stori white pride saut eleven million gallon seawaterros narrat anomali eat film verisimilitud though humor spin tale irrelev romant rhetor come event outsid sphere experi privat meet captain crew relat omnisci regard film action aboard titan testimoni even iceberg impact comprehens cover angl lookout bridg engin room captain crowd rose flashback bad someon backseat bonk bodyshav boyman timeros lament doesnt even pictur jack steerageclass lover leonardo dicaprio mayb that rememb staggeringli beautifulit piti writerdirector cameron lean heavili vapid love stori movi propel rest film chestclench stunnerth grandeur royal mail ship titan beauti captur restor filmic incarn costum charact exterior shot paid utmost detail although must said histor least dicaprio charact jack probabl tread time period acquaint use recreat drug yell woooo ship prow friend fabrizio danni nucci didnt help authent suppli cast agenc special ethnic stereotyp nucci italian domino pizza sport absolut worst movi italian accent time exact accent friend would adopt schoolyard pretend italian win ticket card game jack fabrizio overjoy even steerag quarter whilst water line onto first class deck desultorili rambl rose kate winslet demand mother franc fisher stormi fianc billi zane luggag enough kill three packeleph elbowglov triplecorset remark via voiceov slave ship take back america chain tri tell africanamerican honey big featheri hat frothi bloomersmeet jack spoil brat suicid attempt rose drawn vagabond swagger hairless torso fall idiot line like youv got fire insid id hate see go georg luca wrote one film world commun smell superprivileg way deodor wholli alien superpoor henc matter much prettier jack rose soon stood downwind belowdeck stench romanc would come earthi halt retch optionalinstead jack invit sup pinkyrais blather itiner lifestyl bless live devilmaycar bum life cobbl susten whatev ratbrain scheme come along liter know hell sleep next night may romant notion success writer independ wealthi travel fact real buman ocean liner sink rose let go vagrant whilst stay spoil byoch charact selfishli hog one float plank atlantica wellmad mindnumb romanc cheesi usual score low cameron gain point pure due magnific boattippingth climax titan startl visual histor event one aliv earth today saw first hand draw latest forens knowledg combin physic process cameron place u directli deck nightmar vision see situat mount berg impact apathi incredul ultim panic captur violent coloss majesti ship break half pull aft section downward verticallyth death throe rm titan astound realism help compar final scene night rememb wholli inaccur romant portray doom passeng aboard blackandwhit titan sing nobli togeth ship slip away degre angl collect human never levelhead physic sink process entir ignoredwith human onboard cameron boat ignobl scream selfishli grasp punch shoot fall violent onto propel blade smokestack crush passeng deck splinter cabl whiplash foam brine final cataclysm submers vertigin ninetydegre angl cameron titan titanicif even brief aweinspir moment time good king worldmovi maniac visit wwwpoffysmoviemaniacom,neutral

40,"It's a love story. A blockbuster. An historical account. A thriller. An action-fest. It's art-house. It's popcorn. It's.. it's... all of these and none.Many others have gone over the historical inaccuracies in great detail so I will try and avoid mentioning them again, but as someone with a lifelong interest in the Titanic story Cameron's film is immensely frustrating. I have a lot of respect for James Cameron. He is a true master of spectacle, and although I've never met the guy I can imagine he is a grade-A control freak; whatever the criticisms of his films, you do not get to make a $200+ million dollar flick without being well and truly disciplined to your art. The detail is all there: the light fittings, crockery, engine room; the beautiful ship brought back to life in full colour, the bridge/bow/boat deck etc - a small army of crew working to build and light the set, costume designers and so on. The film should be recognized as a huge technical accomplishment for these reasons.Yet the film fails for one very simple reason: storyline.The appeal of the real Titanic story is multifold. It was never ""just a shipwreck"" - ships sink all the time, some larger than the Titanic, some with many more losses (the Lusitania is comparable, yet far less populist) - but the sinking marked the end of a period of human arrogance. No matter how technologically adept we become, fate can always intervene and scupper our best laid plans. No one thinks planes are ""uncrashable"" or that we can somehow buy immunity from a grisly fate. And since the real people on board the Titanic represented every walk of society, from billionaires to those starting a new life, the fact that rich and poor perished together on this brand new ship altered our thinking. When the story starts there are four classes of people: First class, second class, third class ('steerage') and crew. By the end, there are two: living and dead.If the real story was fictional, it could not be dreamt up better. There are so many iconic moments to savour they would barely fit into a 3 hours film: Passengers requesting bits of the 'berg to put in their drinks, the Californian's wireless operator going to sleep, the growing realisation that something is seriously wrong etc -the list is endless. So if it is one of the most enduring stories of human behaviour and ""nature vs man"", why do we need Cameron's wafer-thin plot? As a Titanic buff I watch the special effects with delight. The ship is back from the deep, no question. But I find myself willing Jack and Rose to get out of the way. There are some many fascinating 'real' characters that we never get to more than acknowledge. What makes THEM tick? I get the feeling Cameron is fascinated too, but restrained by the demands of a teenage popcorn audience, who've failed to imagine that a poor boy falling in love with a super-rich girl and sacrificing himself in 24 hours is complete ""poppycock"" (1912) - or in Cameron-speak, ""a bunch of horses**t"" (1997).(Incidentally, if I was a first class passenger on the Titanic, I would feel slightly aggrieved I'd paid so much, since in Cameron's version it seems all passengers are free to wander anywhere they like. Except when it starts sinking of course, then suddenly it's impossible to get above decks.) Head for your nearest iMax cinema and watch ""Ghosts of the Abyss"" - Cameron's slightly cheesy but good documentary featuring much more of the underwater scenes from the film. Or for a more accurate retelling of the story try 1958's A Night To Remember. If you want a love story, go for Romeo and Juliet. For a ""people out of their time"" film, try Les Visiteurs or Bill and Ted.In short, TITANIC tries to be all of these things, and excels at none of them.",love stori blockbust histor account thriller actionfest arthous popcorn nonemani other gone histor inaccuraci great detail tri avoid mention someon lifelong interest titan stori cameron film immens frustrat lot respect jame cameron true master spectacl although ive never met guy imagin gradea control freak whatev critic film get make million dollar flick without well truli disciplin art detail light fit crockeri engin room beauti ship brought back life full colour bridgebowboat deck etc small armi crew work build light set costum design film recogn huge technic accomplish reasonsyet film fail one simpl reason storylineth appeal real titan stori multifold never shipwreck ship sink time larger titan mani loss lusitania compar yet far le populist sink mark end period human arrog matter technolog adept becom fate alway interven scupper best laid plan one think plane uncrash somehow buy immun grisli fate sinc real peopl board titan repres everi walk societi billionair start new life fact rich poor perish togeth brand new ship alter think stori start four class peopl first class second class third class steerag crew end two live deadif real stori fiction could dreamt better mani icon moment savour would bare fit hour film passeng request bit berg put drink californian wireless oper go sleep grow realis someth serious wrong etc list endless one endur stori human behaviour natur v man need cameron waferthin plot titan buff watch special effect delight ship back deep question find will jack rose get way mani fascin real charact never get acknowledg make tick get feel cameron fascin restrain demand teenag popcorn audienc whove fail imagin poor boy fall love superrich girl sacrif hour complet poppycock cameronspeak bunch horsest incident first class passeng titan would feel slightli aggriev id paid much sinc cameron version seem passeng free wander anywher like except start sink cours suddenli imposs get deck head nearest imax cinema watch ghost abyss cameron slightli cheesi good documentari featur much underwat scene film accur retel stori tri night rememb want love stori go romeo juliet peopl time film tri le visiteur bill tedin short titan tri thing excel none,positive
41,"James Cameron's 'Titanic' shares a similar motto to Marmite, ""you either love it or hate it"", I for one love this film, yes I know it's got a drawn out romance story, but there's just something about the 3-hour fill of the film that makes its such a spectacularly emotional and beautiful movie. I saw this a lot when I was growing up, this was one of the films of my childhood, it is truly a powerfully resonant and visually stunning movie of epic proportions. Personally I favour the British original 'A Night to Remember', but this is a pretty close contender. Winner of 11 Oscars, James Cameron's romantic-disaster epic is a triumph of cinema that boasts perfect chemistry between Kate and Leo as the lovers bound for tragedy. Many people disregard this film nowadays solely because it's become the most popular film ever made alongside Cameron's other epic 'Avatar', and whilst 'Titanic' is definitely not one of my favourite films, it's just so powerfully amazing and no doubt at all it has once brought a tear to everyone's eyes. The main aspect I love in this film is James Horner's haunting score that was a key ingredient in the film's success, it is simply perfect, too bad Celine Dion had to close this on her awful pop version.

Well, very little--that is why this review is rather short.I give the film a 9 because it isn't perfect. Some of the characters, to me, seemed a bit simplistic. But, no matter if you like them or not, there's no denying the awesomeness of the film. After all, it looks like you are on a huge cruise ship and the special effects of the wreck (this isn't exactly a spoiler!) are amazing.

48,"If only James Cameron could write dialogue!  This is a well-produced fictionalization of the Titanic and her maiden voyage, with all the historical details just right (well, except for some really minor stuff ...).  The romantic story overlaying it all lends poignancy and drew in the crowds, in record numbers.  The performances are, by and large, good-to-excellent, except for Leonardo DiCaprio, who did much better in his earlier movies (up to and including The Quick and the Dead), and Billy Zane, who's never been able to do more than look like a movie star.Cameron is a great director of action, and a good visual story teller.  Too bad he's such a control freak, he ought to allow someone to re-write all his dialogue so that it sounds like humans talking, not T-1000's.

50,"I saw the movie for the first time when it arrived on video, needless to say that I had very high expectations for this movie because I heard a lot about it. I watched the movie and I remembered my first reaction when I finished watching it, my reaction was: ""This is it?"" Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad movie, not at all. But I was disappointed about it all and it just didn't met my expectations.Everybody knows the true story about the ship the ""Titanic"" and there are many movies/series made about it already. New about this movie is the love story. It's always dangerous to put a love story in a movie because if the love story doesn't work the movie doesn't work. The love story does work for most parts in this movie, except for some scene's in which I just don't buy it.Although the movie is very long it doesn't really ever get boring, which is of course a good thing. The best part of the movie is the sinking and you can see that James Cameron is really one of the best Action directors in the business.The acting isn't great but not bad either. The special effects look good with the exception of a few needless scene's. The movie is also full of visual mistakes (for instance you can clearly see the camera in a scene, which is a HUGE mistake that I noticed on my first viewing) and the characters in my opinion aren't really interesting enough.Although the movie got more credit then it really deserved I can still recommend this movie to everybody.

51,"I detested this movie so much when I first saw it that I really wanted to give it one star, but as bad as I still think it is, it is fairly well-made and at least the technical department earned their salaries here (though quite frankly I thought that some of the CGI effects screamed ""FAKE!"" louder than the scale models used by Roy Ward Baker in 1958's A NIGHT TO REMEMBER). What sinks this movie for me (pun very much intended) is the fictional love story forcibly inserted by Cameron, doubtless with the cynical intention of attracting teenage girls. Which it did. By the millions.When Oscar time rolled around, Hollywood apparently decided that 1997 was the year to call the movie that made the most money *Best Picture,* to say nothing of the other ten Oscars it won, plus three nominations. Now I have not seen every movie ever to win the Best Picture Oscar, but of all the ones I have seen, this one has to be the least deserving of the honor.For starters, aside from the fictional romance, there is nothing new here. I made mention above of Roy Ward Baker's 1958 film A NIGHT TO REMEMBER, which is THE definitive dramatic film about the Titanic disaster: there are no fictional characters, no romantic heroes or heroines; Baker chose to tell the story plainly, in an almost documentary fashion that still carries a huge wallop fifty-two years later.Cameron's film, by comparison, though it is wonderful to look at (obviously no expense was spared, from costumes to special effects), is a curiously cold and uninvolving piece of work except for when Leo and Kate are on the screen. Cameron's fatal mistake was that he forgot that the Titanic disaster was a real-life human drama; Roy Ward Baker knew this, and his film, fully an hour-and-a-half SHORTER than this one, yet manages to show the terrible loss of humanity of all classes that terrible night. Cameron's film has little feeling for any of the subsidiary characters, with a couple of exceptions, such as a lusty Kathy Bates, delightful as the unsinkable Molly Brown, and Gloria Stuart, who at eighty-eight came out of retirement to play Rose at age one hundred-one.Unfortunately these bright spots are too far and few between in a much- too-long movie that cannot escape the fact that the central romance is uninteresting at best, and irritating at worst. Cameron shows a shameless disregard for his actors in this film. Leonardo DiCaprio is not the least bit convincing as a young man from 1912; he comes across as a typical California brat who grew up eating Sugar Pops. Kate Winslet, a terrific actress, is horribly misused here; left to her own devices, she often fails to find the right notes, most noticeably towards the end, when she and Leo climb the ship to the near-vertical stern, and she turns to him and squeals, ""This is where we first met!"" The line is awful in and of itself, especially in the context of that moment, but had she delivered it with tears streaming down her cheeks and a great deal of pathos, it might have been palatable. Instead, she sounds like a teenage girl going to a high-school dance.There are a few other good performances in the supporting cast in addition to the two I have mentioned, but unfortunately they and the rest of what was a true-life story of hubris, heroics, class divisions, and self-sacrifice, are buried under the cheap date-movie romance that Cameron inserted. I'll give him credit for one thing: he knew that the love story was what would keep the viewers coming back; had he chosen to simply tell the true story, I don't know if the film would have sunk faster than the ship did, but it most certainly would not have gotten all the undeserved acclaim that it did.If you haven't seen A NIGHT TO REMEMBER yet, get it.

52,"I saw this movie opening day and it took my breath away. James Cameron's fictional story of Jack and Rose entwined with real life occurances was haunting and absolutely beautiful. He is an amazing director and writer that this movie would not have worked without him.Kate Winslet was stunning as Rose and this movie belonged to her as you couldn't imagine anyone else playing this role.Leonardo DiCaprio was really good as Jack and  he should have had an  an Oscar nomination for this role and the ever brilliant Billy Zane didn't disappoint in his role as Rose's fiance Cal. His portrayl of Cal was so evil that despite being an awful person, you couldn't help but feel sorry for him, especially when despite all his doings he loved Rose so much.
James Horner's music was just as haunting and he always lifts the movie he works on to the ultimate level.Kathy Bates was equally impressive in a small role and provided quite a few of the laughs of the film. Everything from the special effects, to the sets to the costumes were pure magic.This would have to be one of the most wonderful films of the 20th Century and one that will never be forgotten.",saw movi open day took breath away jame cameron fiction stori jack rose entwin real life occur haunt absolut beauti amaz director writer movi would work without himkat winslet stun rose movi belong couldnt imagin anyon el play roleleonardo dicaprio realli good jack oscar nomin role ever brilliant billi zane didnt disappoint role rose fianc cal portrayl cal evil despit aw person couldnt help feel sorri especi despit do love rose much jame horner music haunt alway lift movi work ultim levelkathi bate equal impress small role provid quit laugh film everyth special effect set costum pure magicthi would one wonder film th centuri one never forgotten,positive
53,"I find it so amazing that even after all these years, we are STILL talking about this movie! Obviously this movie wasn't THAT bad or else people wouldn't even BOTHER to talk about it.  I personally enjoyed this film immensly, and still do!  I guess this film isn't for everyone, but it certainly did touch the hearts of many. As for those that think that this film is ""overrated"" or ""over-hyped""...well, we only have the movie-going public to thank for that! lol*  You see, it's not CRITICS/article writers that make a film ""HUGE"" or a ""HIT"" with the general movie-going public.  PEOPLE make the film a huge success.  With Titanic, everyone was in awe.  Let's face it, a film like this had never been made before.  At least not with the type of special effects needed to really capture the essence of the ship actually sinking. This film is so accurate that even James Cameron timed the actual sinking of the ship in the film with the REAL sinking that fateful day in April 1912. Even the silverware for goodness sakes matched!  Give this movie a break you guys!  The critics thought this movie would sink BIG time!  When this movie actually came out and people started hearing by WORD OF MOUTH (which is the BEST form of advertisement mind you) that this was a good/decent/movie worth seeing, then everyone started flocking to the theaters in droves to see this movie...not once, not twice, but maybe 3 times and more!  So, I really wouldn't say that this movie was ""overhyped""...at least not like the buildup for the MATRIX reloaded or the HULK is being ""overhyped"".  ha!  Critics didn't even think that Titanic would make enough money to cover Cameron's gigantic film budget that it took to make this mammoth of a film.  However, the films money took care of that 200 million budget and MUCH more!  Personally, I LOVE this film.  However, this film might not be for everyone. DOn't say that this film sucks just because of romance though!  THat is the most sexist thing I've ever heard! Disliking a movie just because it has romance in it!  The story was sweet.  The dialogue could have been better, but let's face it...the REAL star of the movie wasn't Leo or Kate...it was that GIGANTIC Ship!

54,"From ""Cavalcade"" in 1933 to ""Titanic"" in 1953, ""A Night to Remember"" in 1957 and ""The Unsinkable Molly Brown"" in 1964, the doom ship Titanic became a voyage of legendary, if tragic, proportions, and in the time leading up to its 85th year spawned a TV movie, a Broadway musical and this masterpiece which had audiences preparing to get tickets for it even before it was finished shooting. The reason is clear: James Cameron, Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio, the promise of effects like you'd never seen in any movie, and a Celine Dion song sung over the teaser trailer that would shoot her to super-stardom.This is told in flashback through the experiences of the 102 year old survivor Rose Calvert (veteran 1930's movie actress Gloria Stuart, nearly forgotten until cast in this), shocked to see a drawing of herself in pristine condition. The nude drawing of her as a young woman wearing a valuable diamond is found in a safe pulled from the ancient wreckage and she immediately notifies the explorers who are searching for more Titanic artifacts and stories. Arriving with pretty much every single belonging of hers as well as her doting granddaughter, Stuart winces in tears with a sudden memory, but insists on going on with her story.From there, we are swept back decades to the luxurious ship on its maiden and only voyage, and the huge vessel is grandly detailed and scaled as only an epic of this nature can scale it to be. Winslet is engaged to the vain Billy Zane, forced by her desperate mother (Frances Fisher) to tolerate him because they are broke and only have their ""name"" to benefit them. Fisher, obviously having married ""up"" , is ultra snobby to the neuvo riche Kathy Bates, and when she meets Jack Dawson (DiCaprio), she knows trouble lies ahead, and her demeanor is enough iceberg for any young lady. Dawson has saved young Roe from committing suicide in the icy waters below, and their first encounter turns into a love that you know can only end tragically.With real life Titanic passengers Brown, John Jacob Astor and his wife Madeline (which would be a great subject for a separate movie), Benjamin Guggenheim and Isadore and Ida Strauss (another subject that would be a touching film), this mixes in these real life characters with the fictional ones. Zane and his humorless right hand man (David Warner) are great villains, with Zane absolutely vile as he psychotically tries to maintain his stolen dignity when he loses his trophy wife to be to a commoner. Watching Zane go psychotic as he stoops to the depths of evil makes you wish he wouldn't make it off, but the writers have an even better plan for him.The film takes well over 90 minutes before the disaster sequences start, and from then on, it is a dizzying, sometimes headache inducing bit of tense moments as DiCaprio, locked to a metal pole to drowned for daring to love Winslet, struggles to be set free. It goes on a bit too long, but for first time viewers is truly frightening. There were buckets of tears being flowed at the Paramount Studios theater I saw this in prior to the release, and even after half a dozen or so viewings, it can still bring them on.Certainly this is filled with cliches, but they are the type of cliches that have worked since the days of the silent movies. This was probably the first film since ""Gone With the Wind"" to be considered a guaranteed Oscar winner, sweeping a good majority of them when it came out. In many ways,, this has very old fashioned ideals and is thus an old fashioned style movie, one of the last of its kind that still worked (""The Artist"" from 20 years later was a rare exception.) I can watch this once a year and still be emotionally turned to mush by it.

55,"Titanic directed by James Cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the Titanic.  The plot is simple, noncomplicated, or not for those who love plots that twist and turn and keep you in suspense. The end of the movie can be figured out within minutes of the start of the film, but the love story is an interesting one, however.  Kate Winslett is wonderful as Rose, an aristocratic young lady betrothed by Cal (Billy Zane). Early on the voyage Rose meets Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio), a lower class artist on his way to America after winning his ticket aboard Titanic in a poker game.  If he wants something, he goes and gets it unlike the upper class who are so concerned with their social worries.  The two fall in love and the audience sees the sinking of the Titanic primarily through their eyes.The movie begins in modern times with the exploration of the wreck by a group searching for treasures, that sunk with the Titanic, which has recently occurred.  One of the survivors of the Titanic, Rose DeWitt Bukater, who had heard of the exploration of the wreck on television and is flown to the boat where the search is being led from to tell of what she remembers to help the search.  She gets to telling her memory of the one and only voyage of the Titanic.  With this, the scene shifts to Southhampton, Ireland where the Titanic set sail from on April 10, 1912 as all the passengers are boarding.  After another stop on the Irish coast Titanic went out to see on its maiden voyage across the Atlantic bound for New York. Historically the first few days of the voyage went by uneventful, but the fictional plot of the story is developed during this time as Rose sees the hopeless entrapement of an engagement that she is in to the wealthy Cal Hockley and falls in love with third class passenger, Jack Dawson. Captain Smith alledgedly as shown in the movie was urged by the White Star Line Director to increase the speed of the ship so they would make the newspaper headlines and receive extra publicity by arriving in New York on Thursday night and not on Friday morning as planned.  Smith then ordered the fateful decision going against his thirty-two years of experience to stretch the Titanic's legs out to full speed.  The Titanic had reports that the waters in the Atlantic they were sailing in were full of icebergs, but they ignored these warnings and proceeded at full speed as shown in the movie.  On April 15, 1912 at 11:39, an iceberg was sighted.  They attempted to shut off the engines and turn the ship out of the path of the iceberg but there was not enough time and the ship hit the iceberg on the starboard side as depicted in the film.  The portrayal of the many small holes in the side of the ship and not one large gash along the side is accurate.  The crew of Titanic sent out distress calls and set off distress rockets as shown until 2:18 when the lights finally failed.  The lights of the California were spotted six miles away but they failed to realize what was going on and did not respond to Titanic's many pleas for help.  The California had tried earlier in the day to warn Titanic of the severe ice that had caused them to stop their trip but Titanic had brushed them off causing the California to turn off its radio and leave the Titanic on its own.  The first class women and children were the first as depicted to be put into the twenty lifeboats that were on the ship.  Overwhelmingly the third class passengers suffered the most amount of deaths of any class and the crew was hit hard in this tragedy too. The word of White Star Line employees and first class passengers was believed over that of second and third class passengers when authorities were trying to gain information of the sinking.  Also, the metal that was used to build the Titanic has been found in recent years under conditions of severe cold, which were experienced the night Titanic sank to be extremely brittle.  Overall, the basic plot is very accurate in its portayal of the events and the times at which these events took place on the Titanic.Many of the characters in the story were not real and created simply for the purpose of the movie or as composite characters to represent possible characteristics and ideas of people on the ship.  The core group of Rose, Jack, Cal, and Rose's mother all were fictional characters added into the story as they represent different groups of people from the time.  Yet many characters such as the Unsinkable Molly Brown; Captain Edward Smith; the ship designer, Thomas Andrew; the White Star Line Representative, Bruce Ismay; and all of the Titanic's officers were real.  The maiden voyage was going to be Captain Edward Smith's last voyage anyway as he planned to retire afterwards.  He had been a part of the White Star Line since 1880 where he worked his way up to his status as the Millionaire's Captain when the Titanic sunk.  The portrayals of the officers is accurate as only four survived the tragedy except for the officer who threatened to kill all of the passengers of the ship with his pistol.  He is on record as acting heroicly and was misportrayed to the point that James Cameron apologized and evoked a monument in his honor in the officer's former Canadian hometown. As shown in the movie there was a language problem between the crew and many of the lower-class passengers from non-English speaking nations.  In addition, Officer Lowe was the only officer who came back in the lifeboat as depicted.  The old people shown in their bed as the water came in their room were based on the Strauss'.  Not wanting to leave her husband's side Mrs. Strauss refused to get in her lifeboat and died with her husband on the Titanic.  Furthermore, Mr. Goggenheim who was shown sipping his brandy and smoking a cigar reportedly did go out like this dressed in his best.  The richest man on the ship, John Jacob Astor, who owned most of Manhattan died nonetheless as well, but his much younger wife was saved in a lifeboat. In addition, Molly Brown was saved and later had medals made up for the crew of the Carpethia that picked the survivors of Titanic up from the water.  Her ticket on the Titanic had cost over four-thousand dollars and by the end of her life she ended up broke.  All of the interiors of the ship were masterfully replacated down to the last pieces of china and silverware. The gymnasium, which is hardly seen is recreated perfectly with all of the machines reproduced to match those seen in old photographs.  The wonderful outfits and costuming were an excellent re-creation of the Post-Victorian era of 1912.  The rich at this time practically ruled everything, as the women's suffrage movement had not quite gotten moving yet.  Women during this time often married for financial security as Rose was considering doing and normally took a back seast status to their husbands as Cal wished for Rose to do.  The rich did not take well to `new money' such as Molly Brown as depicted.  Everything of the time was very formal.  Women had to be escorted to dinner by a male figure as seen with in the dining scenes. Smoking was not very common among women of the time but holders of cigarettes, which were just coming in at the time were used as seen with Rose in the movie.  Men of the time generally smoked cigars not cigarettes. Women were constained physically by their corsets and socially by society. Although James Cameron had no background in historical films he brought in experts of Titanic coupled with two years spent cross-referencing the history of the Titanic and few liberties were taken.  The beautiful cinematography and special effects also helped to make the film even more breathtaking.A recognizable message can be seen in the movie Titanic as the people on the ship had about three hours to contemplate their demise.  The director, James Cameron, shows the various reactions to this time of crisis in people's lives.  Everyone reacts differently and he gets you to think of how you might have reacted had you been in that situation on the Titanic on that fateful night.  In addition, this film is a reflection of the 1990's when it was produced as it gives a look into the wreck of the Titanic.  Only in the past fifteen years has the site of the actual Titanic been found and explored.  This movie was able to give us a deeper look into a disaster that many would not have viewed.  However, the moral question of whether people today should be taking treasures from the wreck of an underwater graveyard is posed.  There have been attempts to stop treasure seeking missions such as the one portrayed in Titanic but all have failed.  As it stands today anyone can make a voyage to the Titanic and take whatever valuables they as portrayed in the film showing the general values of our time on this matter.
Technically the film is very well done.  To get footage of the wreck at the bottom of the ocean it took twelve dives to get all of the footage needed for the movie.  In addition, a special camera had to be created to withstand the intense pressure at the bottom of the ocean.  Cameron did not plan on using the probe to go as far inside Titanic as anyone has in the 88 years since the ship sunk but it worked out that this provided an unique perspective into the ship.  Furthermore, throughout the film fade ins and outs from the wreck of Titanic to the scene of Titanic during its actual voyage.  This shift between the modern scene to the past scene during the voyage works as an excellent transition that makes the story easy to follow in aclear manner.  At the very beginning of the movie a septune recreation is used to recreate the scene when the actual people left the European coast on Titanic giving it distinction from the rest of the events of the film.Titanic plays almost like a historical biography and is like a work of art, a true epic.  Like most history novels, we know the ending, but it doesn't take away from the wonderful treats that can be found in this picture. Certain aspects of this film are Academy Award material including costuming, sound, cintematography, and editing.  If you like interesting characters that will give you an insight into the life of characters in the early 1900's and how they face disaster, then this movie definitely is for you.",titan direct jame

For me Titanic is an experience not just a movie. The fact that the sinking is real gives it that next level of visceral emotion. I never forget that the sinking of Titanic is real, but the gloves come off once we see the captain prepare to go down with the ship. All hell really breaks loose at that point and that's when I'm truly reminded how horrific that must have been, even if you were a survivor.

He's actually a loser with nothing to give a woman. Rose is portrayed as a very proper young lady with an enviable pedigree yet one that should be resented because of privilege.

59,"Well, I'm not going to completely bash this movie. For what it's worth, it's decent entertainment, moves along at a fairly good pace - impressive, considering this is a three hour flick - and Kate and Leo were okay (though both can do much better). I expected worse, knowing it had been horribly over-hyped and that James Cameron was evil (one can argue about how evil). Also, the sets and Kate's dresses were very pretty. That's about it for the positives. The story is shallow and full of holes, most of the dialog is plain silly, and the whole movie is, basically, spectacular kitsch. I honestly think Titanic is probably one of the least deserving Academy Award winners ever - and in the same year as LA Confidential, Good Will Hunting, and even The Full Monty.

62,"Once upon a time there was a director by the name of James. He brought us wonderfully, thrilling science-fiction such as Terminator and Aliens. These movies were the stuff blockbusters were made of and he looked to have a fantastic future ahead of him as the dawn of computer generated special effects landed upon the film industry. Terminator 2 showed gave us glimpses of what was possible in this new era........and then it happened...................1997........countless awards..........obscene amounts of money............outlandish barrage of advertising............maximum profit margin........Titanic was here!I have never (ever) been one to jump on the bandwagon and be overly critical for the sake of it, in fact I have often taken the opposite stance from the majority just to get an argument going. Titanic however was a film I only took one single positive out of - that of Kate Winslett being absolutely gorgeous throughout!Quickly - the dialogue was like something out of Beverly Hills 90210, the acting was more wooden than my nephew's tree house, images meant to terrify were actually comical (man falling from ship and hitting propeller), historically false (don't even get me started because there's too much), it had dire theme music (up there with the bodyguard for cheese) and the pointless love story was so tedious, self absorbing and pathetic that it disrespected the plight of everyone else involved (I was glad when he died and disappointed when she did not).It was plainly obvious from the word go that this picture was designed to appeal to MTV watching, bubblegum chewing, boy-with-car chasing, teenage girls (DeCaprio himself resembled something less heroic than the weedy member of a boy band) who would drag their sex-starved boyfriends out for a three and a half hour chick-flick hoping to get lucky later! The worst aspect was that it did not stop at that point. Millions of dumbed down, culture vultures went to see this expensive waste of celluloid because ""it cost so much to produce it must be great"" and ""Steve and Barbara said it was good and they know their movies"". The crowning glory arrived when Titanic swept the boards at the Academy Awards. King James of Hollywood had a serious moment of silence for the victims of the fatal evening on which his three and a half hour farce was based. It looked to me as if he was praying for forgiveness after making a fortune off inaccurately portraying the circumstances that lead to the death of a lot of people. However, if people are stupid and sentimental enough to buy into this kind of rubbish they deserve to get ripped off. Good luck to Hollywood if that is how they want to make money, I'd do it if I had those kind of chances in life!It is right up there on my all time worst movies list with other silly, historically false/human interest tripe like ""The Patriot"" and ""Pearl Harbor"".",upon time director name jame brought u wonder thrill sciencefict termin alien movi stuff blockbust made look fantast futur ahead dawn comput gener special effect land upon film industri termin show gave u glimps possibl new eraand happenedcountless awardsobscen amount moneyoutlandish barrag advertisingmaximum profit margintitan herei never ever one jump bandwagon overli critic sake fact often taken opposit stanc major get argument go titan howev film took one singl posit kate winslett absolut gorgeou throughoutquickli dialogu like someth beverli hill act wooden nephew tree hous imag meant terrifi actual comic man fall ship hit propel histor fals dont even get start there much dire theme music bodyguard chees pointless love stori tediou self absorb pathet disrespect plight everyon el involv glad die disappoint notit plainli obviou word go pictur design appeal mtv watch bubblegum chew boywithcar chase teenag girl decaprio resembl someth le heroic weedi member boy band would drag sexstarv boyfriend three half hour chickflick hope get lucki later worst aspect stop point million dumb cultur vultur went see expens wast celluloid cost much produc must great steve barbara said good know movi crown glori arriv titan swept board academi award king jame hollywood seriou moment silenc victim fatal even three half hour farc base look pray forgiv make fortun inaccur portray circumst lead death lot peopl howev peopl stupid sentiment enough buy kind rubbish deserv get rip good luck hollywood want make money id kind chanc lifeit right time worst movi list silli histor falsehuman interest tripe like patriot pearl harbor,neutral

Nothing can come to the scale of it; every shot is made to drop your jaw, to blow your mind and give you most mind-blowing movie-going experience.

67,"It's really quite odd. When Titanic first came out,the reviews were mixed but the public generally loved it,those who disliked the film were definitely in the minority. Over the years,it has became somewhat fashionable to slag Titanic off,even if a great many of those people who did so were probably amongst those who made it such an enormous hit in the cinemas. Titanic is flawed,definitely,sometimes greatly so. However,it's also a tremendous achievement for it's director James Cameron. Mixing a real disaster with romance is harder to do than some might think. Maybe he did have a right to say ""I'm king of the world"" when the film won Best Picture at the Oscars. Just once.The modern day opening is excellent,making effective use of some of Cameron's real footage he took of the sunken Titanic. There is a real sense of mystery. Than we flash back to the Titanic being boarded,and the film stalls just a little for around two hours. The attention to detail is amazing {even all the cutlery matched,you know} and there is nothing wrong with an extremely slow build up to action-think of The Seven Samourai. However,the central romance between Leo and Kate is often badly written and unconvincing. For a start Kate's Rose would certainly not have done two things she does in the film as quickly as she did {Obviously thousands of teenage girls seeing the film in 1997 would disagree with my views}. We also have to suffer Cameron constantly labouring the point that the poor people on the ship are better than the rich people.However,the final 80 or so minutes,detailing the sinking,is simply brilliant film making. The suspense is built expertly,even though we know what will happen,and climaxes with some technical shots which are still impressive. Perhaps there is a little two much emphasis on the central couple,but there are some truly moving moments,and it really feels true,although of course Cameron did play with the facts a little here and there,as at least one descendant of one of the survivors has pointed out. The following sequence involving the boats is extremely haunting,with some especially good use of sound. As for the final scene,it does manage to be pretty moving,it's schmaltzy but it works {though hardly original,think of Somewhere In Time and various 40s romantic fantasies}.Titanic has some excellent use of CGI {watch out for the transitions from present to the past on the sunken ship} and one glaringly bad special effect-the iceberg which looks like polystyrene. James Horner's best selling score is really quite poor and only occasionally brings the emotion it should do. Performances are generally excellent and sometimes succeed in overcoming some thin characterisation {such as Billy Zane as Rose's fiancée,who even has to suffer with far too much eye make up!}Overall Titanic is still worth seeing,and sometimes it really does hit the heights that it should. It succeeds more than it fails,which is impressive in a film as ambitious as this.",realli quit odd titan first came outth review mix public gener love itthos dislik film definit minor yearsit becam somewhat fashion slag titan offeven great mani peopl probabl amongst made enorm hit cinema titan flaweddefinitelysometim greatli howeverit also tremend achiev director jame cameron mix real disast romanc harder might think mayb right say im king world film best pictur oscar onceth modern day open excellentmak effect use cameron real footag took sunken titan real sen mysteri flash back titan boardedand film stall littl around two hour attent detail amaz even cutleri matchedy know noth wrong extrem slow build actionthink seven samourai howeverth central romanc leo kate often badli written unconvinc start kate rose would certainli done two thing film quickli obvious thousand teenag girl see film would disagre view also suffer cameron constantli labour point poor peopl ship better rich peoplehoweverth final minutesdetail sinkingi simpli brilliant film make suspens built expertlyeven though know happenand climax technic shot still impress perhap littl two much emphasi central couplebut truli move momentsand realli feel truealthough cours cameron play fact littl therea least one descend one survivor point follow sequenc involv boat extrem hauntingwith especi good use sound final sceneit manag pretti movingit schmaltzi work though hardli originalthink somewher time variou romant fantasiestitan excel use cgi watch transit present past sunken ship one glaringli bad special effectth iceberg look like polystyren jame horner best sell score realli quit poor occasion bring emot perform gener excel sometim succeed overcom thin characteris billi zane rose fiancewho even suffer far much eye make upoveral titan still worth seeingand sometim realli hit height succe failswhich impress film ambiti,positive
68,"As an epic, it doesn't change, even a little, my perception of life. As a love story, I've seen better. However, I have to say - technically - and as entertainment - Titanic is great. The special effects, the replica of the ship, and all other technical details are a feast for the eyes. And it certainly entertains, as it never lapses to boredom and although it's over 3 hours long, it doesn't really register.Anyway, I'd say it is quite worth the watch.

70,"Firstly I am going to start this review by saying this in my top ten favourite films of all time.I am not a major fan of chick flicks so my reasoning behind my love of this film is based on the historical context of the movie rather than the love story.In 1995 when I was 15 I was asked by my English teacher to find a subject to write about and that it can be about anything I wanted.Up to this point in my life I knew nothing about the Titanic at all, so whilst perusing in the school library I come across a book about the Titanic written by Robert Ballard. From that moment I have been obsessed with anything about Titanic (I received a B for my subject which I was very proud of and I still have it to this day)
If anyone who knows this Robert Ballard found the wreckage of Titanic on the 1st September 1985.So now my review - this film is such an accomplishment in cinema history back in 1997 as James Cameron delivers an incredible masterpiece of storytelling not just the love story but the story about the ship itself. Because being a fan of Titanic the real emotion of this film is not Jack and Rose. It's the tragic story of all those people who went through this experience.The set pieces on this film were incredible and it's visually stunning. The score is so amazing it makes me emotional.Now I've said this from the first time I see Leonardo DiCaprio in This Boy's Life back in 1993 and What's Eating Gilbert Grape? 1994 that he was an amazing actor.The emotional scene that really gets me the most in this film is when Old Rose says that there were 20 boats floating nearby and only one came back.So I applaud James Cameron for this amazing film because it wouldn't have been possible if he wasn't such an avid lover of the sea and actually doing the research to bring this to life.",firstli go start review say top ten favourit film timei major fan chick flick reason behind love film base histor context movi rather love storyin ask english teacher find subject write anyth wantedup point life knew noth titan whilst peru school librari come across book titan written robert ballard moment ob anyth titan receiv b subject proud still day anyon know robert ballard found wreckag titan st septemb review film accomplish cinema histori back jame cameron deliv incred masterpiec storytel love stori stori ship fan titan real emot film jack rose tragic stori peopl went experienceth set piec film incred visual stun score amaz make emotionalnow ive said first time see leonardo dicaprio boy life back what eat gilbert grape amaz actorth emot scene realli get film old rose say boat float nearbi one came backso applaud jame cameron amaz film wouldnt possibl wasnt avid lover sea actual research bring life,positive
71,"""Titanic"" is really two movies: one of them is an exciting, James Cameron-style action film, ""The Poseidon Adventure"" with better special effects; the other is a dull as dirt period romance, so simplistic and cliché it seems like something conceived in the mind of a twelve-year-old girl.Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet became household names because of their performances in this, and they do invest the film with a great deal of spunk, but they've got absolutely terrible material to work with. Cameron is clearly no writer, but he is a good director of action, so just tune in to this one once the big ship has actually hit the iceberg, and you'll save yourself a lot of time.The supporting cast includes Kathy Bates as Molly Brown, Frances Fisher as Winslet's uptight and aristocratic mother, Victor Garber as the skipper..er...captain, and Billy Zane, in an embarrassingly awful role as the movie's villain. The character as written is like something out of a silent movie, and Zane plays him as such -- if he had a mustache, he'd be twirling it. Too bad his performance is completely at odds with the totally contemporary performances of just about everyone else.Cameron reveals an almost fetishistic obsession with recreating the glamour of the famed ocean liner, and the glee with which he then goes about demolishing it and the people on it borders on the disturbing. It's like watching a little boy build an elaborate train set just so he can have the pleasure of blowing it up with firecrackers.Grade: B",titan realli two movi one excit jame cameronstyl action film poseidon adventur better special effect dull dirt period romanc simplist clich seem like someth conceiv mind twelveyearold girlleonardo dicaprio kate winslet becam household name perform invest film great deal spunk theyv got absolut terribl materi work cameron clearli writer good director action tune one big ship actual hit iceberg youll save lot timeth support cast includ kathi bate molli brown franc fisher winslet uptight aristocrat mother victor garber skipperercaptain billi zane embarrassingli aw role movi villain charact written like someth silent movi zane play mustach hed twirl bad perform complet odd total contemporari perform everyon elsecameron reveal almost fetishist ob recreat glamour fame ocean liner glee goe demolish peopl border disturb like watch littl boy build elabor train set pleasur blow firecrackersgrad b,positive

73,"No matter how many times I watch this it's like being with an old friend. Even if it's on Television I can tune in at any point and enjoy the ride.The acting, casting and costumes are implacable. Every inch of set design has been thought out (we will excuse the shots of the upper deck on the bow during the sunset shots).The film doesn't age and I would despise a remake. All aspects that Cameron has put in place just work. The sumptuous legendary Titanic with all its complex characters and intertwining stories of class struggle and inequality whilst precariously depicting real people in a real tragic episode. The soundtrack alone is hauntingly beautiful and conjures up images from the film in one's head wherever they may be.Titanic will forever linger in the mind and as every April comes around the films tragedy is paralleled by the reality of the sinking.

75,"This film is an absolute masterpiece, yet whenever it's discussed people often dismiss it or rarely praise it.There is so much more to this film beyond the romance and the iceberg, it's a time capsule. You can tell how much care and attention to detail went into it, the sets and costumes are incredible, the political/class subtext is very well crafted.

76,"It's sometimes difficult to assess a movie that was such a phenomenon in its day. Titanic was a gigantic hit upon release, talked about everywhere, unavoidable. In parallel to its massive popularity, there was also a backlash of people denouncing it as clichéd and overly sentimental, a lot of whom were probably deliberately disliking it because of its ubiquity. Now, it's of that awkward age where it's too recent to merit classic status but too distant to still really be talked about much. As such its standing in posterity seems to be undecided, as yet.Historical romantic epics like this have long been around, and have long done well at box offices and awards ceremonies. And yes, they may be formulaic, but there is a certain craft in ticking all the boxes. Titanic works by bringing us in, with those opening scenes, with the position of a clinical observer of the wreck, as we might have seen it in books or documentaries. The framing narrative has a modern familiarity that we can relate to. We are then gradually eased back into the past, and the story of the ship and those who sailed aboard her become humanized. And I'm not just referring to the central love story. In writing his screenplay, James Cameron goes to lengths to pick hundreds of tiny strands, from the real fates of historical personages to brief flashes of unnamed figures. This broad, human retelling of a great disaster gives Titanic a wonderful richness, not to mention a deeper poignancy.Cameron was at this point best-known for his blockbusting actioners like Aliens and the Terminator movies, so as a director he might have seemed out of his depth on Titanic. But Cameron was always a professional, never a show-off, and he could handle weighty subjects with maturity. He doesn't faff about with the camera, usually keeping it still while all the movement is within the frame. And of course, when the movie turns more action-orientated during the ship's sinking, his experience puts him in good stead. The collision with the iceberg is so suspenseful that, every time I see it, I still hope the ship will turn in time. Throughout the movie, there are a lot of point-of-view shots, more than most filmmakers dare to use these days, but the idea is to bring us close to the sensation of being there. But perhaps Cameron's greatest strength is his finding of an apt image to tell a story in an instant, from a man with his family frantically thumbing through a translation book to find his way off the ship, to Ismay's guilty face against the side of the ship as he is lowered down.The studio took a gamble in allowing Cameron to cast two lead players who were as young and inexperienced as Winslet and DiCaprio, but it paid off. Winslet is not a traditional beauty, but she has a vivacious personality that makes her attractive and instantly likable. At first glance, DiCaprio seems to have been hired for his looks, but he proves to have a deep sincerity, such as when he confronts Winslet and confesses his feelings towards her. And after all, it's moments like this where performance counts the most. But what makes these two work is their believable youthfulness and that eager rapport between them. Passionate love stories that take place over a day or two can easily seem a bit false, but Winslet and DiCaprio seem so great together the briefness of their affair are irrelevant.This diamond of a movie is not, I'll admit, without a few flaws. Despite the brilliant construction of the screenplay, the dialogue is woefully trite. The special effects are typically over-ambitious '90s CGI, with texture-less surfaces and too many fake people (although to be fair it still looks better than, say, a scale-model would). But whereas these problems would stick out like sore thumbs in a lesser picture, Titanic has such a grand sweep and emotional power that they become insignificant. I hope cinematic history will judge Titanic well because regardless of hype and counter-hype, it is everything a movie should be.",sometim difficult ass movi phenomenon day titan gigant hit upon releas talk everywher unavoid parallel massiv popular also backlash peopl denounc clichd overli sentiment lot probabl deliber dislik ubiqu awkward age recent merit classic statu distant still realli talk much stand poster seem undecid yethistor romant epic like long around long done well box offic award ceremoni ye may formula certain craft tick box titan work bring u open scene posit clinic observ wreck might seen book documentari frame narr modern familiar relat gradual ea back past stori ship sail aboard becom human im refer central love stori write screenplay jame cameron goe length pick hundr tini strand real fate histor personag brief flash unnam figur broad human retel great disast give titan wonder rich mention deeper poignancycameron point bestknown blockbust action like alien termin movi director might seem depth titan cameron alway profession never showoff could handl weighti subject matur doesnt faff camera usual keep still movement within frame cours movi turn actionorient ship sink experi put good stead collis iceberg suspens everi time see still hope ship turn time throughout movi lot pointofview shot filmmak dare use day idea bring u close sensat perhap cameron greatest strength find apt imag tell stori instant man famili frantic thumb translat book find way ship ismay guilti face side ship lower downth studio took gambl allow cameron cast two lead player young inexperienc winslet dicaprio paid winslet tradit beauti vivaci person make attract instantli likabl first glanc dicaprio seem hire look prove deep sincer confront winslet confess feel toward moment like perform count make two work believ youth eager rapport passion love stori take place day two easili seem bit fals winslet dicaprio seem great togeth brief affair irrelevantthi diamond movi ill admit without flaw despit brilliant construct screenplay dialogu woefulli trite special effect typic overambiti cgi textureless surfac mani fake peopl although fair still look better say scalemodel would wherea problem would stick like sore thumb lesser pictur titan grand sweep emot power becom insignific hope cinemat histori judg titan well regardless hype counterhyp everyth movi,positive

85,"The legendary film of all time is «Titanic». This film is directed by James Cameron. It's based on the true story of the biggest ship Titanic, who crashed in 1912. It had the most Oscar nominations 11 times. Stars such as Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet starred in the film.It was filmed in Mexica where a full-size model of the ship was made for filming. A pool with a displacement of 4 million liters was also created there. When creating the Titanic, computer graphics and special effects were actively used
This film tells the story of the first and, unfortunately, the last voyage of the largest ship at that time. As well as the love story of two young people who met each other on this ship. The story of a young rich girl, Rosa, who sailed in first class, and a poor artist who won a ticket to a ship in cards.I recommend this film for viewing, because it is very beautifully filmed, beautiful interiors and costumes. A beautiful love story, this is a legendary film that everyone should watch. The whole world knows about him and he personifies all the romantic films of the world. It is about true love, about tears, about friendship, mutual understanding and sacrifice.

88,"Yes, it was wildly over-rated, in that respect serving only to inflate Jim cameron's ego.  Yes, it is certainly not the best movie ever made.  Yes, the script was weak, and the acting isn't really too wonderful.  Leonardo DiCaprio has the blandest, most obvious lines I've ever heard, does not act them very well at all, and basically suvrives only on his smile and the fact that everyone knew millions of teenage girls would be swooning.  I didn't understand Billy Zane's character, but he wasn't on very much, so I didn't have to be confused by him a lot.  I do think it's awful that all those girls cried only over ""Leo"" and not over the thousands of people who died, but for those who were watching for another reason, there is still a pretty good movie there, in my opinion.  The scope is amazing, with all the sweeping shots, lavish, mostly accurate details, and spectacular effects. Cameron really orchestartes the mood of every scene wonderfully; though some of it is pretty cheesy, for the most part I really was caught up in it. While the acting isn't spectacular, as I said, some of the people turn in pretty good performances.  Kate Winslet did for the most part, though in the action scenes, where she's given the role of hero, instead of doing something with it she just pants away and screams for Leo and does nothing else.  Otherwise, she handles the acting pretty well.  Frances Fisher, Kathy Bates, the captain, the designer of the ship, and the many third-class passengers were also good.  Even though the movie focused on fictional characters and not on these people, there's enough there to really affect you.  Seeing them being so cruelly and unjustly shut up in steerage and not being allowed to get to the lifeboats is a pretty powerful scene.  And just tell me you weren't in some way moved by the mother singing her kids to sleep, the old couple (who were real) hugging each other in bed, the people getting shot and killed by smokestacks, the captain shutting himself in as the windows break, and the band playing on and on and on.  I mean, come on! This really happened!  It was the most affecting part of the movie for me. I guess it was because I was so affected by it that I felt sad when Leo went under.  All the nay-sayers concentrate on the fiction part, which admittenly isn't up to the standards of these scenes, but also is not the only thing there.  Perhas if people just didn't look at the first part and only at the second part, they'd understand one reason why this movie was so successful. Yes, the teenage girls were a big factor, or so we hear, but plenty of other people went two and three times besides them, and they went because they were so affected by it that they just had to see it again.  Maybe it doesn't deserve to be the most successful movie ever made, but it deserves to be a classic, and undoubtedly will be no matter what anyone says.  Yes, it has flaws, but what movie doesn't?  There's more to this movie besides those flaws, if you just look.",ye wildli overr respect serv inflat jim cameron ego ye certainli best movi ever made ye script weak act isnt realli wonder leonardo dicaprio blandest obviou line ive ever heard act well basic suvriv smile fact everyon knew million teenag girl would swoon didnt understand billi zane charact wasnt much didnt confus lot think aw girl cri leo thousand peopl die watch anoth reason still pretti good movi opinion scope amaz sweep shot lavish mostli accur detail spectacular effect cameron realli orchestart mood everi scene wonder though pretti cheesi part realli caught act isnt spectacular said peopl turn pretti good perform kate winslet part though action scene she given role hero instead someth pant away scream leo noth el otherwis handl act pretti well franc fisher kathi bate captain design ship mani thirdclass passeng also good even though movi focus fiction charact peopl there enough realli affect see cruelli unjustli shut steerag allow get lifeboat pretti power scene tell werent way move mother sing kid sleep old coupl real hug bed peopl get shot kill smokestack captain shut window break band play mean come realli happen affect part movi guess affect felt sad leo went naysay concentr fiction part admittenli isnt standard scene also thing perha peopl didnt look first part second part theyd understand one reason movi success ye teenag girl big factor hear plenti peopl went two three time besid went affect see mayb doesnt deserv success movi ever made deserv classic undoubtedli matter anyon say ye flaw movi doesnt there movi besid flaw look,positive

90,"The 3D re-release of James Cameron's 1997 big screen epic based on the R.M.S Titanic's 1912 sinking, starring a young Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet—to-date, has received the most acclaim of any of the other nearly 30 film, documentary and made-for-television productions. His initial 2D version of the modern classic Titanic saga snagged a record 11 of its 14 Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture and Best Director for Cameron, whose cinematic achievement ignited renewed interest in the most infamous maritime disaster in history for another generation of ardent viewers. The very fact that the strategic timing of the digitally enhanced movie coincided with the 15th anniversary of the original picture and the 100th year commemoration of the incident that occurred at approximately 2:20 am on April 15, 1912, set the stage for local and international observances. Reports cited 25 million people visited centennial exhibits worldwide. Although the exact numbers are slightly skewed, over 1500 of the more than 2,200 passengers and crew on board were tragically lost at sea after the luxury ocean liner struck an iceberg in the icy waters of the North Atlantic. Billed at the time as ""unsinkable,"" the ship, built at a cost of $7,500, 000 was bound for New York harbor when it sank on its maiden voyage from England, four days into the estimated 137-hour trip. The sinking garnered huge headlines around the world largely due to widely publicized advance launch announcements by the White Star Line.Numerous depictions of the colossal tragedy quickly followed with two produced the same year. The first completed just 29 days later: Saved from the Titanic, was written by a survivor who also starred in the silent film destroyed in a studio fire. Similar titled features included a 1943 Titanic that emphasized the president of White Star urging the ship's captain 'to make the fastest possible crossing to NY,' a second in 1953 and A Night to Remember in 1958, which depicted the facts from the standpoint of the most senior officer to survive the ill-fated shipwreck. The addition of special effects to the heart-tugging, romantic blockbuster delivered even more impact to put you right there amid the action and drama. While it may not have been as effective in early scenes, it improved the quality of the sequences leading up to the fateful night. Given the new discoveries, as well as discrepancies uncovered in ""Titanic: The Final Word with James Cameron"" during the 30 plus dives he's made to the wreckage since serving as screenwriter, producer and editor of Titanic, this upgrade didn't lengthen the minute runtime—much.",rereleas jame cameron big screen epic base rm titan sink star young leonardo dicaprio kate winslettod receiv acclaim nearli film documentari madefortelevis product initi version modern classic titan saga snag record academi award nomin includ best pictur best director cameron whose cinemat achiev ignit renew interest infam maritim disast histori anoth gener ardent viewer fact strateg time digit enhanc movi coincid th anniversari origin pictur th year commemor incid occur approxim april set stage local intern observ report cite million peopl visit centenni exhibit worldwid although exact number slightli skew passeng crew board tragic lost sea luxuri ocean liner struck iceberg ici water north atlant bill time unsink ship built cost bound new york harbor sank maiden voyag england four day estim hour trip sink garner huge headlin around world larg due wide public advanc launch announc white star linenumer depict coloss tragedi quickli follow two produc year first complet day later save titan written survivor also star silent film destroy studio fire similar titl featur includ titan emphas presid white star urg ship captain make fastest possibl cross ny second night rememb depict fact standpoint senior offic surviv illfat shipwreck addit special effect hearttug romant blockbust deliv even impact put right amid action drama may effect earli scene improv qualiti sequenc lead fate night given new discoveri well discrep uncov titan final word jame cameron plu dive he made wreckag sinc serv screenwrit produc editor titan upgrad didnt lengthen minut runtimemuch,neutral

92,"Set around the ill-fated maiden voyage of the RMS ""Titanic"", this is essentially a film in two parts. The first, weaker, element features a young ""Dawson"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who wins a third class ticket to New York on the soon to depart liner. Meantime, the wealthy but unhappy ""Rose"" (Kate Winslet) is up in the posh cabins with her cold and unfeeling fiancée ""Hockley"" (Billy Zane) and her equally unpleasant, venally ambitious mother ""Ruth"" (Frances Fisher). Desperately unhappy, ""Rose"" considers jumping off the prow of the boat, but luckily the charming young ""Dawson"" is on hand to talk her down, and so begins their friendship that causes much chagrin amongst her socially elite companions. That friendship culminates in him making a rather provocative drawing of her, the final straw for her boyfriend and his enforcer ""Lovejoy"" (David Warner). It all looks ominous for both until - part two begins. The ship, speeding along nicely under the command of Bernard Hill's Captain Smith clips the underwater part of an iceberg and now history takes over. James Cameron offers us a purely speculative account of what might have happened as the initially incredulous crew start to realise that maybe it is not just Molly Brown (an excellent Kathy Bates) that's unsinkable! What now ensues are a series of well staged scenarios depicting panic, fear, a fair degree of selfishness and some proper stiff upper lips as the ship has be evacuated and the segregation of the passengers and competencies of the crew start to become life threatening. The visual effects have dated, the smoke from the ship's funnels blows in an strangely symmetrical fashion and the later scenes struggle to convince - but this is really a rather tragic love story with a strong chemistry between the engaging two characters at the top of the bill, and an effective performance from the older ""Rose"" (Gloria Stewart) who takes on the role of narrator 80 years after the disaster. I still find it uncomfortable to watch the actuality of the wreck, which features occasionally throughout the film - I feel like I am quite literally walking through someone's grave; but it does lend a potent hook upon which this lengthy, but well thought out and constructed drama is presented. Criticisms have been made of it's factual inaccuracies, and it may well play a bit fast and loose with some of the real characterisations - but it's a drama, and to be enjoyed has to be appreciated in that sphere.

93,"I see people writing about how great this movie was. It was horrible! The acting was sub-par at best. It made a lot of money because teenage girls went to see the movie 7 times in the theaters because of Leonardo. Where the hell did they get the money? Anyway, I wanted to learn more about the Titanic; why it sank, what was running through a lot of people's minds; maybe even a little conspiracy stuff. Does anyone realize that certain people didn't even board the ship because there was a fire on board before it even took off? No, you don't because all you see is a rich girl falling for a poor boy and he paints her naked (did that corny junk at least tip you off that the movie was stupid?).I did cry in during one scene, though.

Not to mention how amazing the cgi was during this time. The director was definitely ahead of his time. I love the love story between Jack and Rose I feel like it puts you right on the shipped with them and kind of let you feel what it would've been like being there and having no clue about the tragedy that lied ahead. I feel like their story really helped you empathized with the people on the ship.

96,"I wasn't really looking forward to this film, its a 3 hour romance movie and I am not a big fan of romance, but I gave this a chance and I have to say this is genuinely one of the best films I've ever seen. The movie manages to focus on a relationship between 2 different classes while also keeping it interesting with mystery, an intensity of what might happen, dread for the inevitable ending and also make many other characters interesting in there own right. The romance is done in a very realistic way and because of all the reasons I mentioned, the naturalistic acting of the actors and just how fun most of the characters are to watch on screen the movie really works. They also show the present and while I personally think that's the weakest part of the movie it does supply some interesting plot points and make the film more enjoyable overall as you're not constantly stuck in the past, the ending is also given a much more satisfying conclusion due to the present time scenes. Finally the 3rd act of the movie where the ship comes to its end is done in a brutal way showing just how much ruffles death it caused, how desperate the people where and how sad it was. The movie doesn't pull a punch and due to its long run time you almost feel like you know what it'd be like and almost like you yourself where there.

97,"Winner of 11 Academy Awards including Best Picture, the highest-grossing motion picture of its time and a cultural phenomenon that possibly has no equals, Titanic is an extraordinary feat of blockbuster filmmaking that presents its gifted filmmaker at the apex of his craft as he offers a spectacle of such breathtaking cinematic ingenuity & profound emotional depth that it can still rival & demolish most tentpole releases of today on most fronts without breaking a sweat.Written & directed by James Cameron, the story takes a simple premise of two star-crossed lovers from different social classes who fall in love on the maiden voyage of the ill-fated vessel. It is a safe narrative framework to apply amid the backdrop of a tragedy but it is carried out with such warmth, grace & sincerity that we are fully immersed & invested in the unfolding love story and are already on-board when the inevitable happens and turns the sweet, tender romance into a tense, thrilling ride.Despite the story marking a radical departure for Cameron when compared to his earlier efforts, he steers the production ship with sophistication and directs each scene with unfailing authority to deliver the desired goods. James Horner's exquisite & evocative score is as essential to the viewing experience, for it elevates & enriches the journey by an enormous magnitude. And it doesn't end there, for the performances are just as brilliant, with Leonardo DiCaprio & Kate Winslet leading from the front with an infectious chemistry that just works.Overall, Titanic is an immaculately crafted & flawlessly executed Hollywood epic that blends old-school melodrama with astounding visuals to deliver a grand, memorable & powerfully affecting experience. Establishing James Cameron as the one artist you never bet against, catapulting its leads into overnight stardom and still retaining every bit of its magic, appeal & emotional impact after all these years, Titanic is one of the greatest achievements of its medium and is a romantic saga for the ages that engulfed & enraptured a whole generation unlike anything before or since.",winner academi award includ best pictur highestgross motion pictur time cultur phenomenon possibl equal titan extraordinari feat blockbust filmmak present gift filmmak apex craft offer spectacl breathtak cinemat ingenu profound emot depth still rival demolish tentpol releas today front without break sweatwritten direct jame cameron stori take simpl premis two starcross lover differ social class fall love maiden voyag illfat vessel safe narr framework appli amid backdrop tragedi carri warmth grace sincer fulli immers invest unfold love stori alreadi onboard inevit happen turn sweet tender romanc ten thrill ridedespit stori mark radic departur cameron compar earlier effort steer product ship sophist direct scene unfail author deliv desir good jame horner exquisit evoc score essenti view experi elev enrich journey enorm magnitud doesnt end perform brilliant leonardo dicaprio kate winslet lead front infecti chemistri worksoveral titan immacul craft flawlessli execut hollywood epic blend oldschool melodrama astound visual deliv grand memor power affect experi establish jame cameron one artist never bet catapult lead overnight stardom still retain everi bit magic appeal emot impact year titan one greatest achiev medium romant saga age engulf enraptur whole gener unlik anyth sinc,positive
98,"What can you say about Titanic not yet said by another person, or named in another review?. Titanic is, without a doubt, a strong film, a compelling story, a attracting one. I myself have a big love/hate relationship with this movie. In 1997, when it was released, and cynical 90's where at it's highest, I knew this movie was not going to be for me, I knew which was going to be my reaction to this film. We all knew James Cameron, he made ""The Terminator"" in 1984, Aliens in 1986, and ""Terminator 2"" in 1991, all of them decent (not great) action flicks, with one common denominator, LOTS OF MONEY. And that is James Cameron about, he spends and earns tons of money, because (Regardless of your love or your hate for him) he makes the right choices. Avatar sucked, just putting it out there. But what was that worked so much about Titanic?. We might say that Leo DiCaprio or Kate Winslet, or the huge budget of which we where all informed of. I want to think that it was the Leo-Mania, of women that time, after Romeo+Juliet and ""Who's eating Gilbert Grape"", or the fact that it got unbelievable amount of money for it advertising, or the good visual effects, or the Oscar swept, or the lazy, easy to entertain story, or the bland characters, which everybody could be identified with, cause it's easy to identify with so general personalities. I wanna believe that, but it is not true in a whole. Well, it's true in part, but the greatest factor of the success of this film, was truly it 's quality. Not it's story, nor it's characters, those where clichéd and bland (But entertaining, it was an entertaining story told a million times, not like ""Avatar"", a lousy story told a million times). The fact that Rose and Jack know each other for about two days and decide to risk their lives for each other is pretty distracting, but, what the hell, Disney did that to us in all of it's movies. So, why 7 stars if I think all this crap about this movie? Because this movie is great, really great, I don't want it to be, but just look at it, it's so big, it's so fancy, the costume, the production, the visual effects, the amazing cinematography, the pacing, everything was correct, and makes you feel this three hours film like a two hours film, you want more, and not because it let you expecting more, just because it was amazing, and you want to see that again. So, to sum up. I don't see this as a great story, and I don't believe characters where great, but technically it was one of the most complete movies ever released. Look at the Oscars it won. Best Picture, Best director,Best editing, Best Cinematography, Best sound, Best sound effects, Best costume design, Best art direction, Best Visual effects, Best song and best score. And I agree with all of them, I think it is amazing visually and has a great score, even if I hate ""My heart will go on"" (Maybe it was Celine's Dion fault), and acting wasn't awful neither, regardless of the blandness of the characters, Kate Winslet was very good, Billy Zane was a nice over the top villain, and Leo DiCaprio was Okey (Just okay). So, I really like this movie, I can watch it over and over, even do it's not at all perfect, or it has way more cons than pros, it's hypnotizing, its easy to watch, it was made with a lot of effort and it shows, it's full atmosphere, full visual, and a relaxing story and characters.

101,"I see little point in being the two thousandth six hundred and nineteenth person in reviewing this movie but why not? I saw this movie on its release, being a ten year old child I was more concerned about seeing a young naked female than watching fifteen thousand five hundred and three people die.Such a movie was shut away in the back of my small silly mind and revived on the odd occasion through out my life. Over all I presumed this movie had little to no impact on my life until I realized it inspired my artistic talent.That mysterious picture of Rose was set in my mind from a very young age and inspires me to this day along with the other pictures in Jacks portfolio. Anyone with an artistic flare would know what I am talking about.Later on in life I presumed this movie was a propaganda piece and took less care to even notice it. Until I took notice.
It became evident that this movie portrayed two peoples exceptionally well, the rich and the poor.
That was the division and a sad one at that.
Its easy to focus on the love life of Jack and Rose but easier to focus on the indignation of the rich and poor and I think the movie might of underplayed that.
Which is acceptable.Its easy to say the movie was a tragic one but its easier to say it represents a heart of darkness and it is that darkness that makes one cry.

I thought that the film did a good job of displaying the hardships and diversity between social classes.

Leonardo DiCaprio (one of my favorite actors) and Kate Winslet play amazing roles as Jack and Rose, and they do it justice!

108,"Titanic is now a film which people go out of their way to dismiss. Being contemptuous towards the film is the fashionable thing to do. Admitting you like the film marks you as being desperately uncool. Yes, the Titanic-mania of 1997-98 was a bit much. The box office records, the 11 Oscars...at some point people said enough was enough. But this is a film not so easily dismissed. Perhaps it was not worthy of the unprecedented frenzy which surrounded it. But it certainly does not deserve the derision it has received. It is a very solid film. A compelling story, beautiful visuals, stellar performances...this film has much to recommend it. James Cameron risked a lot to bring his vision of Titanic to the screen. The risks paid off. Titanic is great entertainment, truly captivating, at times legitimately thrilling. It's not a perfect movie, maybe it falls a touch short of true greatness but only by the thinnest of margins. All the hype, and all the eventual backlash, can't obscure the fact that this is indeed a very good movie.Of course this film is ultimately destined to turn tragic. But the film is not so much about the sinking of a ship. It is a love story. A very unique, heartwarming love story. A story about a young woman who found the love of her life. And found herself. All in the span of a few days aboard the ill-fated Titanic. Part of the film's charm is that this woman, Rose, tells us her story herself. 101 years old when we meet her Rose takes us back to the Titanic. And with her words she brings the great ship, and its passengers, back to life. One of those passengers is Cal, an arrogant man to whom, much to her chagrin, Rose is engaged. Her family needs Cal's money. Rose does not love him but family, and society, dictate she must marry this rather reprehensible man. But then things take a turn. Rose, in unusual and potentially embarrassing circumstances, meets Jack Dawson. While Rose enjoys first-class splendor Jack is a man from another world. A third-class passenger, no money to his name, no standing in society. Jack has no place in Rose's world. But, rather inevitably, Rose decides she wants a place in Jack's world. Yes, it is one of those scarcely believable stories in which a woman falls madly in love with a man she just met. But in her heart Rose knows. Jack is the one. She must follow her heart. She will throw away her privileged life to be with the man she loves. Unfortunately Cal is not going to give her up easily. But before this conflict can play itself out an iceberg intervenes.The love story of Rose and Jack is easy to embrace, especially when you contrast Jack, so good-hearted, with the vile Cal. Leonardo DiCaprio performs the role of Jack very well, making you believe there is so much more to this guy than is readily apparent. Jack is no ordinary third-class nobody and DiCaprio captures this unique individual wonderfully. But for as good as DiCaprio is it is Kate Winslet who is the real star here. Rose goes on an incredible journey of personal growth and Winslet nails it every step of the way. Rose is radiant, smart, witty and ultimately heroic. Winslet brings all those characteristics to the screen perfectly. Rose finds she is stronger, in so many ways, than she ever imagined. It takes a great actress to evolve along with such a character. And Winslet is clearly a great actress. For as good as DiCaprio and Winslet are in the two key roles the performance of Billy Zane as Cal, the main antagonist, leaves much to be desired. Zane takes Cal's villainy to cartoonish levels, by the end it's impossible to take the character seriously. Spitting his lines rather than speaking them Zane seems absolutely desperate for attention. Unfortunately the attention he brings upon himself is that of sticking out like a sore thumb in an otherwise stellar cast. Cal had to be evil to make the film's story work. But Zane overplays it so badly you half expect to find out that it was Cal who steered the ship into the iceberg and that he did it on purpose.Zane aside the rest of the supporting cast is excellent. While the lead characters are fictional there are many true-life figures aboard the ship. Some, such as ship builder Thomas Andrews, come across very well. Others, such as White Star Line managing director J. Bruce Ismay, do not. Whether those they portray are ultimately heroic, or quite the opposite, the cast by and large do an excellent job bringing these historical figures to life. And Cameron, with a great visual sense, beautiful sets, and state of the art effects, brings the ship to life. Titanic sails again. For the film to really work you had to believe you were really aboard a ship steaming across the Atlantic. Cameron makes it happen. We're right on board, right there with the passengers as they embrace the ship's majesty. And right there with them as the ship sinks to the bottom of the ocean. It is the love story which is at the heart of the film's success. But the sinking of the ship is spectacular, both haunting and thrilling. Perhaps the most fun sequence in the film comes when Rose wanders down to third-class where a raucous party is in full swing. We know that nearly all of those passengers are doomed. But Rose ensures they will not be forgotten. In telling us her story she tells us theirs as well. Through her Cameron has given a voice to all who were lost on that tragic night. Titanic is a film not without its flaws. But it is a film journey well worth taking. Three hours fly by as we follow the first, and last, journey of the great ship.",titan film peopl go way dismiss contemptu toward film fashion thing admit like film mark desper uncool ye titanicmania bit much box offic record oscarsat point peopl said enough enough film easili dismiss perhap worthi unpreced frenzi surround certainli deserv deris receiv solid film compel stori beauti visual stellar performancesthi film much recommend jame cameron risk lot bring vision titan screen risk paid titan great entertain truli captiv time legitim thrill perfect movi mayb fall touch short true great thinnest margin hype eventu backlash cant obscur fact inde good movieof cours film ultim destin turn tragic film much sink ship love stori uniqu heartwarm love stori stori young woman found love life found span day aboard illfat titan part film charm woman rose tell u stori year old meet rose take u back titan word bring great ship passeng back life one passeng cal arrog man much chagrin rose engag famili need cal money rose love famili societi dictat must marri rather reprehens man thing take turn rose unusu potenti embarrass circumst meet jack dawson rose enjoy firstclass splendor jack man anoth world thirdclass passeng money name stand societi jack place rose world rather inevit rose decid want place jack world ye one scarc believ stori woman fall madli love man met heart rose know jack one must follow heart throw away privileg life man love unfortun cal go give easili conflict play iceberg intervenesth love stori rose jack easi embrac especi contrast jack goodheart vile cal leonardo dicaprio perform role jack well make believ much guy readili appar jack ordinari thirdclass nobodi dicaprio captur uniqu individu wonder good dicaprio kate winslet real star rose goe incred journey person growth winslet nail everi step way rose radiant smart witti ultim heroic winslet bring characterist screen perfectli rose find stronger mani way ever imagin take great actress evolv along charact winslet clearli great actress good dicaprio winslet two key role perform billi zane cal main antagonist leav much desir zane take cal villaini cartoonish level end imposs take charact serious spit line rather speak zane seem absolut desper attent unfortun attent bring upon stick like sore thumb otherwis stellar cast cal evil make film stori work zane overplay badli half expect find cal steer ship iceberg purposezan asid rest support cast excel lead charact fiction mani truelif figur aboard ship ship builder thoma andrew come across well other white star line manag director j bruce ismay whether portray ultim heroic quit opposit cast larg excel job bring histor figur life cameron great visual sen beauti set state art effect bring ship life titan sail film realli work believ realli aboard ship steam across atlant cameron make happen right board right passeng embrac ship majesti right ship sink bottom ocean love stori heart film success sink ship spectacular haunt thrill perhap fun sequenc film come rose wander thirdclass raucou parti full swing know nearli passeng doom rose ensur forgotten tell u stori tell u well cameron given voic lost tragic night titan film without flaw film journey well worth take three hour fli follow first last journey great ship,positive
109,"Being of a rather sensitive nature, I steered clear of ""Titanic"", mostly because I did not want to witness the deaths of the 1500+ people who perished in the icy Atlantic waters in 1912. Thus I only recently saw the film on video, months after all the hype, the awards, and subsequent hoopla had played itself out. ""Titanic"" is certainly a lush, beautifully photographed and well-mounted film, although it is almost a bit too ""slick"" for my tastes. I thought Leo and Kate were blandly likable, but I was not very much interested in their characters or their performances. The supporting cast, however, was top-notch, in particular Frances Fisher's remarkably restrained performance as Rose's mother. Ms. Fisher did more acting with a 3-second, tight-lipped glance of disapproval then Leo did with 3 hours worth of stilted dialogue. And Billy Zane managed to twist his classically handsome features into an oily, and sometimes frightening, visage of callow shallowness. The wonderful Kathy Bates always lends a touch of class to whatever role she undertakes, and as Molly Brown she doesn't disappoint. I would have been much more interested in the plot if the story had been told from Molly's perspective rather than Rose's. But the real point of the film is the tragedy itself, which is depicted with harrowing, overwhelming clarity during the sinking sequence. On this level, I think the film is fully realized; however, the fictitious story line is seriously flawed, and I have a difficult time believing Leo as a romantic leading man. In ""Titanic"" he's more like the arrogant kid who should be taken to the woodshed and spanked.",rather sensit natur steer clear titan mostli want wit death peopl perish ici atlant water thu recent saw film video month hype award subsequ hoopla play titan certainli lush beauti photograph wellmount film although almost bit slick tast thought leo kate blandli likabl much interest charact perform support cast howev topnotch particular franc fisher remark restrain perform rose mother m fisher act second tightlip glanc disapprov leo hour worth stilt dialogu billi zane manag twist classic handsom featur oili sometim frighten visag callow shallow wonder kathi bate alway lend touch class whatev role undertak molli brown doesnt disappoint would much interest plot stori told molli perspect rather rose real point film tragedi depict harrow overwhelm clariti sink sequenc level think film fulli realiz howev fictiti stori line serious flaw difficult time believ leo romant lead man titan he like arrog kid taken woodsh spank,neutral
110,"When Michael Bay made Pearl Harbor, he must have been watching this film over and over again. He repeated many of its strengths and all of its weaknesses.Both films are modern retakes on unforgettable historical events. Both feature spectacular special effects and appealing, talented actors. And both films are rendered mediocre by the same weaknesses: a hackneyed, cliche-ridden romance plot and the weak, clunky dialogue that accompanies it. Add in a few two-dimensional stock characters to back up our young lovers and you've got the modern Hollywood version of the historical epic. Kurosawa and Lean must be spinning in their graves.Nonetheless, I have to give Cameron some credit. He may not have made a really great film since The Terminator or maybe Aliens, but he's never made a boring one to my knowledge. Titanic entertains in spite of its weaknesses--it moves along at a good clip and is well-photographed. Cameron certainly captures the look of the era.The bulk of the credit for this film's success, however, must got to the two charismatic leads. DiCaprio and especially Winslet do an admirable job with the limited material they're given. The scene that worked best for me was when Rose has to rescue Jack, who's been left handcuffed in a room that's rapidly sinking below the waterline. After trying (unsuccessfully) to get men to help her--the expected course of action for a young woman of her time--Rose grabs and axe and sets out to rescue her lover, swallowing back tears and her uncertainty. We see her, in that moment, taking the first steps towards becoming the bold, confident older woman charmingly portrayed by Gloria Stuart in the modern-day sequences. Cameron's very good at showing female characters finding previously untapped depths of character and strength, and he successfully goes back to that well in Titanic. If only he'd punched up the dialogue and done justice to some of the secondary characters, Titanic could have been a great film.

112,"This 1997 movie, ""Titanic"", does a wonderful job at recreating the maritime disaster that struck this mighty passenger ship on its maiden voyage. However, the fictional story of the kindling, but doomed romance of a very unlikely couple is totally unbelievable. Decaprio delivers an adequate performance, but he is unfortunately miscast. Never once did I believe, the sophisticated and mature beauty played by Winslet would ever be romantically interested in someone who looked like a common and mischievous high school boy. This budding romance never rang true; thus, I found it exceedingly difficult to become emotionally involved when their inevitable demise was at hand. The only redeeming value of this movie was its special effects and the long drawn out sinking scenes. And of course, that's what this movie was supposed to be about anyway.",movi titan wonder job recreat maritim disast struck mighti passeng ship maiden voyag howev fiction stori kindl doom romanc unlik coupl total unbeliev decaprio deliv adequ perform unfortun miscast never believ sophist matur beauti play winslet would ever romant interest someon look like common mischiev high school boy bud romanc never rang true thu found exceedingli difficult becom emot involv inevit demis hand redeem valu movi special effect long drawn sink scene cours that movi suppos anyway,neutral
113,"This film is an insult to the intelligence of the common garden slug. The romance between DiCaprio and Winslet is completely unbelievable, with no real chemistry between the two. The script is complete garbage, crafted solely in the believe that the public is as idiotic as the creator of this film. Though the sinking of the ship is well crafted and visually stunning, there is no pity to be felt for the cardboard characters that inhabit this film. The 3 hours or so spent watching this horrible film could be more constructively used watching paint dry. The plot is slipshod and centered not on the tremendous agony and suffering of those soul's lost on the Titanic, but on the self-centered interests of a girl leaving behind her obligation to her family for a 3-day fling with an artist, which is consumated in the back of a car. My hope is that this film is somehow exposed to the people as the massive dung heap that it is. I suggest people who liked this inane, insulting piece of garbage view a film of real emotional power that was also crafted from historical events from the 1910's, ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT. I also recommend those who liked this film view the reviews it got from Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times, who exposes the film's huge weak spots and lack of heart.",film insult intellig common garden slug romanc dicaprio winslet complet unbeliev real chemistri two script complet garbag craft sole believ public idiot creator film though sink ship well craft visual stun piti felt cardboard charact inhabit film hour spent watch horribl film could construct use watch paint dri plot slipshod center tremend agoni suffer soul lost titan selfcent interest girl leav behind oblig famili day fling artist consum back car hope film somehow expo peopl massiv dung heap suggest peopl like inan insult piec garbag view film real emot power also craft histor event quiet western front also recommend like film view review got kenneth turan lo angel time expo film huge weak spot lack heart,neutral

117,"On a purely technical level, Titanic was considered at the time the crowning achievement of a filmmaker who's always strived to top his last cinematographic entry with the next. Up until that point and still to this day, he's managed to do just that. He's always made the most of the technological advantages at the time and always come up with a jaw-dropping, mesmerizing visual spectacle. Even at times when budget constraints and uncooperative technical crew, due in part for his apparent lack of experience and fresh off- the- boat from his first serious outing on the directorial chair for The Terminator, like it was the case in Aliens, he's always managed to deliver. It sure does take him a long time to come up with the next one, but everytime he does, he hits the box office's bullseye.
This time around and, with one of the more simplistic storylines ever put to the big screen, he brings us one of the most memorable and fondly remembered movies of the late 90s.
From the very first shot of the movie, those sepia color-corrected images that convey a haunting feeling of remembrance and loss, to the first images of the research vessel subs exploring the entrails of the haunted ship, we plunge right into what it must have felt like walking onto the deck of the Titanic. And we go back to the plot. As I said before, using the simplest of plot devices, a , on the other hand, very well told love story with tinges of social clashing, we are treated to a 3 hour, eye - catching spectacle that moves along at a whip-like pace. With very strong performances all throughout, gorgeous cinematography and production design, state-of-the-art visual and practical effects and a perfect score by the great late James Horner, this is probably one of Cameron's best efforts behind the camera and a movie for the ages. Needless to say, the strongest asset of the movie is its third and final act, with the depiction of the sinking of the titular ship and the resulting mayhem. That, as always, and with the character development groundwork previously laid out by Cameron, is the main reason to watch this movie, and why the audience is so invested in what's happening onscreen. As I said, great movie and larger-than-life characters to go with it.",pure technic level titan consid time crown achiev filmmak who alway strive top last cinematograph entri next point still day he manag he alway made technolog advantag time alway come jawdrop mesmer visual spectacl even time budget constraint uncoop technic crew due part appar lack experi fresh boat first seriou outing directori chair termin like case alien he alway manag deliv sure take long time come next one everytim hit box offic bullsey time around one simplist storylin ever put big screen bring u one memor fondli rememb movi late first shot movi sepia colorcorrect imag convey haunt feel remembr loss first imag research vessel sub explor entrail haunt ship plung right must felt like walk onto deck titan go back plot said use simplest plot devic hand well told love stori ting social clash treat hour eye catch spectacl move along whiplik pace strong perform throughout gorgeou cinematographi product design stateoftheart visual practic effect perfect score great late jame horner probabl one cameron best effort behind camera movi age needle say strongest asset movi third final act depict sink titular ship result mayhem alway charact develop groundwork previous laid cameron main reason watch movi audienc invest what happen onscreen said great movi largerthanlif charact go,positive

119,"Titanic is a staggeringly expensive and elegant love story, set against one of the most shocking maritime tragedies in history. Prior to its release, the media had their knives out for director James Cameron and were poised like vultures to cut him down to size. The budget had spiralled out-of-control, the film was scheduled with a running time of 3 hours, and everyone predicted a critical and financial disaster of unprecedented magnitude. As it turns out, Titanic is actually a good film. Not an excellent film, which many people seem to suggest, but definitely a good film. The second half in particular, which deals with the sinking of the ship and the chaos and panic that sweeps through the passengers, is very well made cinema.In the present, treasure hunters discover aboard the wreckage of the Titanic a drawing of a naked woman wearing a priceless diamond necklace. An old lady named Rose (Gloria Grahame) sees the drawing on the TV news. She calls in immediately, claiming that she is the woman in the picture. Rose is flown out to the dive centre in the Atlantic, where she narrates the story of how she came to be the subject of the drawing. She tells how a penniless American youth, Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio), won a ticket onto the Titanic during a card game in Southampton. She tells how she as a young woman (Kate Winslet) was travelling in first-class with her fiancée, banker Cal Hockley (Billy Zane), and how the two of them were unhappy in their relationship. Gradually, Jack - an aspiring artist - and Rose came together and began to fall in love. Then, the unthinkable happened and the Titanic hit an iceberg....For 90 minutes or so, Titanic almost lives down to the disastrous reputation that had been predicted of it before its release. It is a naive, slushy romantic story in which the love affair that develops is unconvincing and unbelievable. The characters of Rose, Jack and Cal are lifted straight from the pages of a Barbara Cartland-style, clichéd love-and-passion romance. But the film dramatically improves once the iceberg strikes. Cameron is into more comfortable territory at this point, showing his dazzling technical talents and his mastery of spectacle and excitement in a prolonged sinking sequence of true quality. The film suddenly becomes more purposeful and urgent, more exciting and moving. For upwards of an hour, we witness an authentic and harrowing event from a perspective of remarkable realism.Titanic eventually emerged as a phenomenally successful film, and recouped all its budgetary outlay plus a whole lot more. It also made the critics eat the words of their negative predictions. Yes, the opening stretch isn't up to much..... but the ship-sinking sequence more than compensates, and transforms this into a very commendable film.",titan staggeringli expens eleg love stori set one shock maritim tragedi histori prior releas medium knive director jame cameron poi like vultur cut size budget spiral outofcontrol film schedul run time hour everyon predict critic financi disast unpreced magnitud turn titan actual good film excel film mani peopl seem suggest definit good film second half particular deal sink ship chao panic sweep passeng well made cinemain present treasur hunter discov aboard wreckag titan draw nake woman wear priceless diamond necklac old ladi name rose gloria graham see draw tv news call immedi claim woman pictur rose flown dive centr atlant narrat stori came subject draw tell penniless american youth jack dawson leonardo dicaprio ticket onto titan card game southampton tell young woman kate winslet travel firstclass fianc banker cal hockley billi zane two unhappi relationship gradual jack aspir artist rose came togeth began fall love unthink happen titan hit icebergfor minut titan almost live disastr reput predict releas naiv slushi romant stori love affair develop unconvinc unbeliev charact rose jack cal lift straight page barbara cartlandstyl clichd loveandpass romanc film dramat improv iceberg strike cameron comfort territori point show dazzl technic talent masteri spectacl excit prolong sink sequenc true qualiti film suddenli becom purpos urgent excit move upward hour wit authent harrow event perspect remark realismtitan eventu emerg phenomen success film recoup budgetari outlay plu whole lot also made critic eat word neg predict ye open stretch isnt much shipsink sequenc compens transform commend film,positive
120,"When you talk about 1990's pop culture, it's really hard to not mention, the biggest blockbuster from that decade, Oscar Winner, Best Picture of 1997's Titanic. Directed, written, by James Cameron, the movie had everything that people wish to see in a movie, making it one of the biggest money makers of all time. The movie had plenty of action, history, romantic, and music to get everybody onboard. The movie gives a fictionalized account of the sinking of the RMS Titanic in April 14, 1912. It tells the story of two members of different social classes, high socialite Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet) and working class, Jack Dawson (Leonardo Dicaprio) falling in love aboard the ship during its ill-fated maiden voyage. The movie was so popular, that a 3D version of the film was released on April 4, 2012 to commemorate the centennial of the sinking, earning it more money. The 3D version was pretty good. Titanic spun a number of other successful things such as; musicals, soundtrack, hundreds of different types of merchandise, books about the Titanic, a video game about Titanic and countless rip-offs movies. I think a good reason why a lot of people went to see this movie is how simple the story is. Yes, it's a bit predictable and pretty recycled from old Hollywood style that previous Titanic type movies had, such as 1958's A Night to Remember & 1953's Titanic. You can really see it, if you look close enough. It's full of familiar tropes and clichés. Still, the movie concept really got update to epic scale with the expensive budget, well use, in the films visual, special effects, costume, sets, and other sides of the production. James Cameron really made the movie felt like it overlap a lot of genres. It was great historical romantic action movie with many subplots like a treasure finding mystery suspense, a horror lifetime movie melodrama about female abuse, a social commentary film about classism and social Darwinism, etc. etc. Indeed, the movie is mostly label as a love movie, and this is where some people might be turn off. People do love story, when there is something in stake. By putting their lives in stake, people want to see them overcome the dangers. People also love movie if the two actors playing a couple really do show on chemistry on film. Both Leo & Kate did well in their roles showing their charm, but their characters don't have much depth to them. We really don't see, much faults in them. Their characters are very simplistic people. Also, some of their dialogue made the love story seem unrealistic or too silly to be taken serious of. Some people might hate the song by Celine Dion, 'Heart will go on' but in my opinion, the song works so well. I do think, it does get a little bit overplayed. I also have to give mad props to James Horner's score. All of the music in the film does give the movie, its great epic romantic tone and later, it's intense edge. I had lots of fun, watching the Titanic lower class party. The music there, really fit the scene. The movie also has great cinematography, as it was all eye candy to me. You can't help going in front of any ship bow, and not think of that scene from this movie. Indeed, you're feel like you're flying. For a PG-13 movie, I was deeply surprise how erotic, it was. I was just a little kid, when it first came out, the movie was the first time; I noticed that women had pubic hair. I found the sex scenes and the nudity to be tasteful. Still, the whole love affair, really does undermine, the time wasted that could cover the real victims of the Titanic sinking, more. While the actors playing supporting historical characters were all great in their roles. They were also all one-dimensional props. I still felt emotional to them, when 'Nearer, My God, to Thee,' to the tune of Bethany was playing. It was hard not to feel something about the film. Another thing people might hate is the pacing. The movie is really long and seem slow at times. The movie is also a bit historical inaccurate, but the movie went into great details to make the movie seem like the Titanic, you see here is the real Titanic. Buy the DVD as there are a lot of great special features like delete scenes, commentary, and behind the screens. The 2012 DVD version also clean up some of the big mistakes. It felt like the special edition that wasn't destroy the original work. If you happen to find it on TV, just note that it will be cut down, and censor a bit. It's nearly unwatchable. Overall: Sink or swim. Is the movie, the best Titanic movie ever? So-far, yes. Is it the worst? So-Far-no. It was safe exceptionalism type of movie. I wouldn't say, it's the smartest movie, but I would say, its lack of complexity doesn't make it not watchable. From the opening shot to the bittersweet ending, it was just amazing to watch.

124,"The producers and writers of Titanic obviously believed they'd bore and alienate the targeted teen and twenty-something audience to the point of losing them if the characters had the attitudes, mannerisms and style of speech that was appropriate for the time, so they had Jack (Leonardo Dicaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslett) speaking contemporary dialogue in a contemporary style, or at least contemporary for '97. A young man in 1912 would not say, ""You seem more like an indoor girl."" Aside from a certain hostile type of mental patient or the most outrageous and anti-social bohemian agitator, young adults in 1912 did not repeatedly tell their elders to shut up. The creators of the film are counting on what they perceive to be the teen and young adult's lack of knowledge or interest in the values and social customs of the very early 20th century. Since they want the audience to get swept away by the drama and romance of Jack and Rose they want them to relate to everything about them. I remember that this was billed as somewhat of a a fantasy re-imagining of a real event, but this type of historical revisionism, I think, in which human behavior is simply made more familiar, is an insult to any viewer with a 3-digit I.Q. One continuity problem that really gets me is how, when the ship is sinking and Jack and Rose are still inside, the water level is lower and the water becomes calmer around them every time they have a conversation. Again, the makers of the film don't want the reality of the disaster to encroach on, or distract us from, the passionate young romance they're trying to draw us into. Clearly the creators of the film think that the romance is a bigger draw for a major segment of the audience than the story of an enormous disaster that killed over 1,500 people and I'm sure they're right, but often when true and fictional stories exist in the same movie, one weakens the impact of the other, and it's certainly true in this case. I haven't seen the new 3D version but I assume the only change is the 3D effect.

127,"James Cameron's masterpiece, Titanic, is incontrovertibly the greatest anecdotal tale ever to grace the film industry. This movie has to be Cameron's masterpiece that has never been rivalled in its grandeur. This movie has a phenomenon ability to connect the audience on an emotional level, taking them on an emotional rollercoaster as the characters form bonds and face adversity from all flanks of life. This story juxtaposes the idea of love and power in different shades and angles. Leo and Kate have a relationship that is based on human emotions and desires for bonding, while Zane challenges that connection of human connection by flaunting his wealth and attempting to allure Kate with his affluence. This creates tension between the characters, and the story is very effective at controlling the crescendo so that the audience has an opportunity to connect emotionally with the characters that face this adversity. With Zane always prowling about throughout the movie, trying to win over Kate's heart with his money, there seems to always be a sombre feeling looming in the background as the events unfold between the main characters. This ominous sense of dread that is always suspended in the atmosphere seems to tie in well with the fact that the entire Titanic, the biggest commercial ship in the world, is also portend to face an unknown tragedy in the future. The director effectively seems to symbolize that human love between Kate and Leo as the impervious Titanic ship itself, and reveals the vulnerable side of it. This poetic depiction is demonstrated with so much gusto and romance, that one cannot help but fall in love as the inevitable tragedy dismantles that colossal giant known as love present in all human beings.",jame cameron masterpiec titan incontrovert greatest anecdot tale ever grace film industri movi cameron masterpiec never rival grandeur movi phenomenon abil connect audienc emot level take emot rollercoast charact form bond face advers flank life stori juxtapos idea love power differ shade angl leo kate relationship base human emot desir bond zane challeng connect human connect flaunt wealth attempt allur kate affluenc creat tension charact stori effect control crescendo audienc opportun connect emot charact face advers zane alway prowl throughout movi tri win kate heart money seem alway sombr feel loom background event unfold main charact omin sen dread alway suspend atmospher seem tie well fact entir titan biggest commerci ship world also portend face unknown tragedi futur director effect seem symbol human love kate leo impervi titan ship reveal vulner side poetic depict demonstr much gusto romanc one help fall love inevit tragedi dismantl coloss giant known love present human be,positive

129,"Why does this movie suck so bad?  More importantly, why did it win an oscar for among other things, best picture?  There are so many holes in the film's plot, the villian is similar to one in a Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoon (I was wondering why they didn't give him a mustache which he could rub between his fingers), the long sweeping shots of the ship look horrible, the script is lame and filled with cliched action movie lines and all of the scenes taking place in the present day are worthless and have no place.First, if Rose is telling this story from her perspective how is it that she knows what her fiance is always planning?  How does she know what the crew of the ship is talking about before and after the iceberg hit?  How is it that she knows how exactly Jack got on the ship or what he talked about with his friends onboard?  You get the idea?  Now many movies have this problem, but not a best picture winner. Second, the villian who's name escapes me.  He was so cliched.  So evil it was funny.  He's like Travolta in his new horrible film.Third, the fly over shots of the ship look like garbage.  They are so obviously fake, all the people appear as black, lifeless silohoettes walking the ship. Fourth, the script.  How did these horrible lines that Jack utters get in there?  When danger is afoot, no matter how great all he can utter is his best Keanu Reeves impersonation. Fifth, what is the purpose of showing us the salvage crew?  Who gives what these idiots are thinking or doing.  It further complicates things. Why would these people believe an elder Rose just because she says she is the one in the picture.

I only knew her from the Titanic when I was a kid and didn't know how much of an amazing actress she was. But I was really impressed with her in this role.

136,"The film Titanic(1997) written, produced, and co-edited by James Cameron is an epic cinematic masterpiece, that unfolds a captivating narrative of the fateful ship of dreams. It revolves around the heartwarming love story between a young man (Jack) and a woman (Rose), whose passionate bond is disrupted by the clear boundaries of social class. Just as their emotional connection reaches its top, the ship encounters a catastrophic destiny. The sinking ship drives Jack and Rose to struggle for survival in the middle of chaos, ultimately encountering deeply distressing trials.This film has to be one of my all-time favourites. Watching Titanic has never gotten boring to me; even after watching the film several times. The film's set design, both inside and out, immerses you in the Titanic's magnificence. The authenticity is noticeable, drawing you in completely. When the disaster unfolds, Cameron grabs hold of you, pulling you through every painful moment with careful detail.Cameron accomplishes keeping the performance from diverting our focus from the sad reality. Watching the Titanic's destruction isn't enjoyable, or exhilarating, it's deeply painful. Different from typical disaster films, it never feels like we're just watching extras on a set, each person on screen feels like a developed character. The lead-up to the iceberg collision compels you convincingly within the period, giving every character a sense of authenticity. As the ship starts to sink, the shock of seeing the characters disappear is greatly impactful. Throughout much of the sinking, the fictional circumstances of Jack and Rose take a step back, allowing viewers to think about the reality and empathize with the terror of being aboard the ship on that night.The movie presents the love, bravery, and courage that occurred on that fateful evening, illustrating the sinking of the ship and the tragic loss of more than a thousand lives. I would recommend this movie to viewers as young as 13 or 14 as it does have some suggestive matter. Overall Titanic offers many elements. It's a romance, disaster film, an action-packed adventure, filled with humour, and a tragic tale.",film titan written produc coedit jame cameron epic cinemat masterpiec unfold captiv narr fate ship dream revolv around heartwarm love stori young man jack woman rose whose passion bond disrupt clear boundari social class emot connect reach top ship encount catastroph destini sink ship drive jack rose struggl surviv middl chao ultim encount deepli distress trialsthi film one alltim favourit watch titan never gotten bore even watch film sever time film set design insid immers titan magnific authent notic draw complet disast unfold cameron grab hold pull everi pain moment care detailcameron accomplish keep perform divert focu sad realiti watch titan destruct isnt enjoy exhilar deepli pain differ typic disast film never feel like watch extra set person screen feel like develop charact leadup iceberg collis compel convincingli within period give everi charact sen authent ship start sink shock see charact disappear greatli impact throughout much sink fiction circumst jack rose take step back allow viewer think realiti empath terror aboard ship nightth movi present love braveri courag occur fate even illustr sink ship tragic loss thousand live would recommend movi viewer young suggest matter overal titan offer mani element romanc disast film actionpack adventur fill humour tragic tale,positive

140,"Spoilers herein.I admit to a certain admiration of Cameron. Alone among special effects manipulators, he has a solid sense of what works cinematically. When he invests, he invests in a world. That world envelops us with its completeness and magnitude. It is the opposite of, say, Carpenter, who invests in the stage, in the world of the performer rather than the viewer.As far back as `Aliens' this talent has been apparent. This time, he sticks to the formula of a simple story annotated by all sorts of associations. No second plotline. No ambiguities or any questions open for viewer judgment. But he is sensitive to this I think and that is why he chose the most promising young actors that know something about narrative folding. That's where you act both in the space of the story and the world of the viewer. Kate in `Creatures' and Leo in `Romeo' did this. Kate has since grown to master it. His intent is underscored by making the color of her hair more brilliant. I don't know why yet, but this seems to signal such acting, at least in women.But alas, except for the brief scene where Leo draws her - a natural situation for this type of acting - it is absent. Probably Cameron intended something deeper and more nuanced but just couldn't manage it. In this case as well as that of the ship, the vast machine wins.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.",spoiler hereini admit certain admir cameron alon among special effect manipul solid sen work cinemat invest invest world world envelop u complet magnitud opposit say carpent invest stage world perform rather viewera far back alien talent appar time stick formula simpl stori annot sort associ second plotlin ambigu question open viewer judgment sensit think chose promis young actor know someth narr fold that act space stori world viewer kate creatur leo romeo kate sinc grown master intent underscor make color hair brilliant dont know yet seem signal act least womenbut ala except brief scene leo draw natur situat type act absent probabl cameron intend someth deeper nuanc couldnt manag case well ship vast machin winst evalu interest element,neutral
141,"I know in advance this review is not going to be popular; but it is my honest opinion for what it's worth. This is not a review of the 3-D version.The final hour of this movie is incredibly captivating; the effects are astonishing, the human drama endlessly gripping and the horror of the terrible tragedy deeply moving and powerful. Direction by James Cameron is impeccable, he thoroughly deserved his Oscar; the film looks wonderful and the music score is marvellous.But is it really such a classic? I think not, personally. A Night To Remember may have dated effects-wise but it tells the story of The Titanic in a superior way to this movie. The big problem for me is the script; which for the most part I think is quite poor. Cameron lifts whole segments from A Night To Remember, inserts dialogue from the testimonies given during the enquiry into the cause of the disaster, and alters history in a way that must have been quite shocking to the descendants of those involved. Officer Murdoch, for instance. He did not shoot two passengers; nor is it very likely he committed suicide. Murdoch's decision to reverse the engines when the iceberg was spotted probably caused the disaster - Titantic would have missed it had the full ahead order been given; even a nose-on impact would not have sunk the ship. But there is no evidence whatsoever Murdoch, who distinguished himself in the aftermath of the accident, committed suicide. Just a few passenger rumours that one of the officers shot himself.Kate and Leo. Nice acting from Kate, DiCaprio is simply too young for the man of the world artist. He has matured into a very fine actor, but the ""romance"" never convinces me for an instant. Far too much time is spent on it; with the result that the story of the Titanic is sort of shoe-horned into the movie in a series of brief sequences. The whole question of The Californian is omitted to give Kate and Leo more screen time, and The Carpathia barely appears. Lightoller's remarkable escape is hardly referenced: and here the brave but slightly misguided officer comes across as panicky and arrogant. Very unfair indeed.The result is rather fake emotionalism and moonshine, rather like Avatar, in fact, although admittedly Titanic is a better movie.Some of the acting in this movie is also very poor. Billy Zane is quite awful as Cal. He gives a performance that would do Dick Dastardly proud. All he really needed was a few moustache twirls and evil titters. One-dimensional character; one dimensional acting. Excellent actors like Kathy Bates, Bernard Hill and David Warner are wasted in this movie.The film has much to commend it but my honest assessment is that it also has a lot of flaws.

143,"So, I think everyone knows, but in 1997 one of the most successful films of all time was released. And, it's called Titanic, and it was directed by James Cameron. This film won 11 Oscars in 1997 (including the best film) and had a box office success of titanic grandeur, one of the biggest in history, critically acclaimed, adored by the public and revolutionary for its special effects. Well, despite its undeniable legacy, there are reasons that, obviously, Titanic is not as perfect and wonderful as many people think, and that it does not deserve its Oscars or be selected as one of the best films of all time.

145,"I saw this movie when it first came out in theater and the whole theater was packed and for good reason. This has many elements to make a good romance movie, yeah it gets a bit sappy and corny but that is passable. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie when it first came out but acted like I hated it for the sake of hating it. Because it came out sometime when I was in elementary school and all the kids back then was making fun of this movie. Although some of them probably enjoyed watching this movie as well. This is the movie that made Leonardo DiCaprio and made him a teenage heartthrob. So the plot is basically this to put it simply, it's about a romance that blossoms on a ship called Titanic between a poor guy named name Jack Dawson(Leonardo DiCario) and Rose(Kate Winslet). But Rose is engaged to a douche but the romance between Jack and Rose increases even during the sinking of the ship. I am not giving anything away since anyone that knows a bit of history knows that the Titanic sank. And when the human nature when it comes to survival kicks in, that is done in a pretty realistic manner. Even if the romance aspect of this movie is pretty straightforward but at least it's engaging and that is what matters. Everything from the cinematography to special effects were phenomenal for a movie from the late 90's and it's still spot on today.

I have to report that while watching ""Titanic"" I found myself being totally bored by the stereotypical charecters, i.e Snobbish English, Battleaxe American. Cameron has also reeled out loads of cliches and made them 10 times more boring. There is also an undertone of class struggle which is direly executed. As for ""Titanic"" being called a love story, that could never be said as there was no chemistry between the two leads and to me no feelings of love came across (James try watching other Oscar nominee As Good As It Gets for a decent love story). As for the tragedy that was Titanic in the film I did not feel as though the tragedy was fully put across and I left actually feeling numb from this glamourised dross. How this truly terrible film managed to get the Best Film Oscar is beyond me (As Good As It Gets a much better and beautiful film) and how Cameron got the Best Director award is unbelievable although is unsurprising when people like Martin Scorsese do not get an Oscar for films such as Raging Bull, Goodfellas and Mean Streets.",best film ever certainli best film chanc report watch titan found total bore stereotyp charect ie snobbish english battleax american cameron also reel load clich made time bore also underton class struggl dire execut titan call love stori could never said chemistri two lead feel love came across jame tri watch oscar nomine good get decent love stori tragedi titan film feel though tragedi fulli put across left actual feel numb glamouris dross truli terribl film manag get best film oscar beyond good get much better beauti film cameron got best director award unbeliev although unsurpris peopl like martin scorses get oscar film rage bull goodfella mean street,positive
147,"There are two love stories in this film: the first Romeo and Juliet and the second James Cameron and the ship. Every millisecond is thought through, nothing is compromised and the attention to detail is extraordinary. The holes for each rivet in the hull of the 1/20th model were drilled by hand and actors who actually resembled the 1st Class passengers aboard ate and drank using teacups and cutlery stamped with the White Star Line emblem. The production is a seamless mix of miniatures, practical effects, CGI and actual footage from the wreck site and also genius in terms of saving money if you investigate further. There's nothing wrong with Leonardo DiCaprio's performance but Kate Winslet shines and, combined with the backstory of the search for the necklace, Titanic as a whole is an entertaining and respectful blend of fact and fiction, very well paced and doesn't feel like a 3 hour film. I'm a Titanic buff, so biased - the final few minutes of the ship tearing in two with hundreds of people still clinging to the stern makes me wince every time - but James Cameron's version of the disaster genuinely ticks every box.

151,"The problem director and writer James Cameron faces with a story about the Titanic is that the majority of his audience will know what happens. So to make his audience care, he switches the action and main plot from the ship, to a socially inappropriate love story between Jack Dawson and Rose Dewitt Bukater. The trouble is that by incorporating the love story theme into the story, he seems to detract from the feel and humanity that previous Titanic films like A Night to Remember have had. Cameron instead opts for two separate halves to the story rather than melding the two separate elements together. The first half concentrating on building an audience rapour with the two main characters, while the second half concentrates on the special effects fuelled sinking of the doomed liner. This would be forgivable if it weren't for several key factors from the first half, the main weakness being the utterly one dimensional lead characters we are presented with. From Caledon Hockleys loveless millionaire to Rose's trapped innocence to Jack Dawson's poor boy with a dream. Aswell played as these characters are, the performance can't make up for the poorly written characters the actors have been given. Again, with the spectacle of the story of the titanic and the millions of dollars at Cameron's disposal, one could forgive the weakness of the characters, but then the  first half of the story is so entirely cliché ridden and full of predictability that it becomes obvious. It is clear that she will leave her safe life and existence and go with the unpredictability of true love. It is almost as though Cameron knows how to tell this story visually, he's just not sure or not capable of making you care about it. Cameron's writing has always come under scrutiny. The comic book quality of films like True Lies and the Terminator films set the scene for his writing style. The childlike quality of some of the dialogue shouldn't but does stand out. ""Something Picasso"" and Freud, is he a passenger?"" are so dire that they belong in a Farrelly Brothers film, not a $200 million blockbuster. Cameron does seem to be writing from the heart, the trouble is that his heart doesn't seem up to the task. ""It's pay-day boys"" and Dicaprio's now legendary ""I'm the king of the world"" seem not to be spoken by the characters in the film, but by Cameron himself. He is the master film-maker who can resurrect the Titanic and will make a fortune from it.Questions that arise on investigation of the film closely are the gaping plot hole of  Rose's narration and status as the main narrative agent. If the story we see is told from Rose's perspective, how are we granted access to scenes such as the Captain's death and Hockley and Lovejoy hatching the plan to trap Jack? Again, if the story we are being told is not from Rose's perspective and is a general overview of the events, why are we subjected to Rose's story telling voice over? Perhaps this is being overly critical of what is simply meant to be viewed as popcorn entertainment and indeed, the film isn't entirely without its merits. The hour long sinking of the ship is indeed breathtaking and the film does have probably three genuinely special moments. Winslet and Dicaprio's flying scene, the ship breaking in two and Jack's death which is surprisingly touching and moving. The trouble is, especially in a three hour long film, that these few moments don't make up for the other half of the film. In a three hour film, half is ninety minutes, the average length of a Hollywood film, perhaps Cameron should have sacrificed some of the unnecessary moments and concentrated the story into perhaps just over two hours.Cameron's back catalogue of films should prepare us for what we are going to see. The Abyss, True Lies and Terminator 2 : Judgement Day show that as a visionary, he can amaze his audience simply by clicking his fingers. The problem lies with his misplaced attempts to try and bring humanity into his stories. In The Abyss, Cameron wants us to care about the relationship between Mary Elisabeth Mastrantonio and Ed Harris. In True Lies, we are asked to care about Schwarzenegger's flagging relationship with his wife Jamie Lee Curtis. Similarly in Titanic, we are asked to ignore the special effects and care about the characters relationship. If Cameron were to write a out and out blockbuster that did not need characters require the audience to care, he would probably create one of the most amazing films ever to be seen. Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to be what he wants to do.",problem director writer jame cameron face stori titan major audienc know happen make audienc care switch action main plot ship social inappropri love stori jack dawson rose dewitt bukat troubl incorpor love stori theme stori seem detract feel human previou titan film like night rememb cameron instead opt two separ halv stori rather meld two separ element togeth first half concentr build audienc rapour two main charact second half concentr special effect fuell sink doom liner would forgiv werent sever key factor first half main weak utterli one dimension lead charact present caledon hockley loveless millionair rose trap innoc jack dawson poor boy dream aswel play charact perform cant make poorli written charact actor given spectacl stori titan million dollar cameron dispos one could forgiv weak charact first half stori entir clich ridden full predict becom obviou clear leav safe life exist go unpredict true love almost though cameron know tell stori visual he sure capabl make care cameron write alway come scrutini comic book qualiti film like true lie termin film set scene write style childlik qualiti dialogu shouldnt stand someth picasso freud passeng dire belong farrelli brother film million blockbust cameron seem write heart troubl heart doesnt seem task payday boy dicaprio legendari im king world seem spoken charact film cameron master filmmak resurrect titan make fortun itquest aris investig film close gape plot hole rose narrat statu main narr agent stori see told rose perspect grant access scene captain death hockley lovejoy hatch plan trap jack stori told rose perspect gener overview event subject rose stori tell voic perhap overli critic simpli meant view popcorn entertain inde film isnt entir without merit hour long sink ship inde breathtak film probabl three genuin special moment winslet dicaprio fli scene ship break two jack death surprisingli touch move troubl especi three hour long film moment dont make half film three hour film half nineti minut averag length hollywood film perhap cameron sacrif unnecessari moment concentr stori perhap two hourscameron back catalogu film prepar u go see abyss true lie termin judgement day show visionari amaz audienc simpli click finger problem lie misplac attempt tri bring human stori abyss cameron want u care relationship mari elisabeth mastrantonio ed harri true lie ask care schwarzenegg flag relationship wife jami lee curti similarli titan ask ignor special effect care charact relationship cameron write blockbust need charact requir audienc care would probabl creat one amaz film ever seen unfortun doesnt seem want,positive
152,"It's almost too easy to bash this film. So I'll just paraphrase what James Cameron himself said on TV one night about the ""pitch"" meeting for the film...""I got an idea for a film about a boat. It's about 3 hours long and nothing much is gonna happen for about 2 1/2 hours. Then everbody dies and there's no chance for a sequel. And by the way..it's gonna cost you about $200 million to make it. Whaddya think, guys?""Truth be told..the first half hour or so (the Bill Pullman stuff with actual footage) ain't bad, but nothing I haven't already seen on the Discovery Channel. I'll still take Cameron's ""The Abyss"" every day and twice on Sunday. The guy directs a pretty neat little action film. It's just that I like my disposable love stories served with a side order of humor..and maybe some actual ""acting"". You know. The stuff that actors do in movies? In ""The Abyss"", Ed Harris and the gang got into their characters enough to give the movie a nice kick.

156,"I resisted all the hype at the time this film came out, and managed to wait until it appeared on TV before seeing it for the first time. It was a profoundly impressive film, but only in certain respects. The plot was thin and predictable (well, I suppose in a film named 'Titanic', the plot pretty well *has* to be predictable), and the acting was fairly mediocre. I guess what I found so impressive was just the overwhelmingly good job that was done on making you feel like you were right there. Everything from the simulated aerial shots of the ship at the beginning of the film, right through to the close ups of events during the disaster itself is done so well that you can immerse yourself (if you'll pardon the joke) in the experience.It is just a pity that the acting from most of the performers didn't rise to the occasion. It is easy to see why none of the film's 11 Oscars was for acting. I suppose I'm a bit biased because I personally cannot stand DiCaprio, who can't act to save his soul, but I found the other performances to be less than the film really needed.Overall, though, the impressive technical achievement in bringing Titanic to the screen outweighs the human shortcomings, giving the film a rating of 7/10.",resist hype time film came manag wait appear tv see first time profoundli impress film certain respect plot thin predict well suppos film name titan plot pretti well predict act fairli mediocr guess found impress overwhelmingli good job done make feel like right everyth simul aerial shot ship begin film right close up event disast done well immers youll pardon joke experienceit piti act perform didnt rise occas easi see none film oscar act suppos im bit bias person stand dicaprio cant act save soul found perform le film realli neededoveral though impress technic achiev bring titan screen outweigh human shortcom give film rate,positive
157,"James Cameron's Titanic was nothing short of a phenomenon. Like so many others, I went to the pictures more than once to catch the must-see film of 1997. When I first saw Titanic, I was swept away by the whole film. I thought it was a thrilling piece of entertainment. Funny, resonant and exciting in equal measure.But again, like so many others I also feel Titanic has lost a bit of its sparkle over the years. Its times like this you ask yourself why a film you once held in such high regard now ranks so low? Lets see if I can answer that question.There's no denying that on the one hand its an impressive piece of filmmaking. Cameron's direction is slick and economical, something that's served him well since his extraordinary debut with The Terminator. The 3 hour running time zips by without one barely noticing. But somewhere along the way, Cameron fumbles it, and like the Titanic, the film goes down with all hands.Cameron is a self-professed Titanic enthusiast, and he's clearly put a great deal of thought, care and precision into recreating the Titanic, from the jumbo sized pistons in the engine room right down to the tiny portholes on the bow. And he exactingly crafts its destruction, first explained to us through a step-by-step computer simulation.The collision with the iceberg. The gradual flooding of the compartments. Loss of power. The ship splits in half. The eventual sinking. And then we finally see it enacted in the last 90 minutes. It would be churlish not to mention how eerily precise Cameron gets the details of the Titanic.Its a shame the human characters aren't as well developed. Cameron's clout in the industry has allowed him to array a truly extraordinary cast. But save one or two, quite a few characters are little more than cardboard cutouts.Kate Winslet shines as Rose. She does quite well and invests a great deal of resourcefulness and spunk into the part of a débutante forced into marriage. Cameron draws a lot of strength and vitality from her character.As for Leonardo DiCaprio, he brings plenty of enthusiasm to Jack Dawson, a penniless artist from steerage. But his romance with Rose never truly convinces. The relationship only works on simplistic terms by pushing all the right emotional buttons. Exactly why it struck such a chord with audiences. Especially the female members. I remember hearing quite a few ladies in the audience reach for their tissues during Jack's rather maudlin death scene.I couldn't go into detail describing how many people there are to keep track of. Otherwise I'd run out of words. The ones that scored favourably with me are Kathy Bates as the unsinkable Molly Brown, Victor Garber as Mr Andrews the ship builder, and in a small but memorable role Jason Barry as Tommy, an Irishman in steerage who meets a tragic end.As for everyone else, they're all one-dimensional. Billy Zane is cast as Rose's fiancée Cal, a snobbish, controlling tyrant. There's no depth to his character. David Warner is wasted in a thankless role as Zane's ghoulish valet, and Frances Fisher takes the prize of worst offender for playing Ruth, Rose's heartless mother.Cameron waits quite a bit before the actual collision. So you'd be forgiven for feeling more than a little restless for the first hour and a half. There are a few moments that stand out. I quite liked the way the film contrasts the differences in 1st and 3rd class, each having dinner in their own way. And you will definitely sit up and pay attention to Jack drawing Rose in the nude wearing nothing but a priceless diamond.But its really after the crash that the film finally starts getting interesting. This is the part of the story Cameron wanted to tell. He stages the destruction of Titanic with breathtaking regard. Corridors flood with cascades of water. The enormity of the hull pivoting into the air is a terrifying sight. Its in these scenes where the film holds a captive audience. Cameron shoots them with a fanatical immediacy, and watching the destruction of these stylised and impeccably crafted sets is awesome to behold.Yet even in these scenes Cameron miscues it a little. The sinking of the Titanic has been filmed many times (A Night To Remember had to have influenced Cameron). But this is the first to add comedy into the mix. I didn't mind so much in the first half because the people aboard didn't know the maiden voyage of Titanic was doomed. But in the second half, when Cameron tries to make you laugh, its an approach at odds with the dramatic thrust of the story, e.g. the aristocrats aboard want brandies while the ship is sinking. This is hardly believable behaviour, and even disrespects the memories of those aboard. It leaves a bad taste in the mouth.Cameron does demonstrate far too much of a willingness to guess what the people aboard were like. Painting them in unfavourable colours, portraying the officers as officious bureaucrats, and even having one of them shooting passengers even when there is no evidence to support that.The final scenes for Jack and Rose go on too long in my opinion. His final words, which are really hackneyed and mawkish belong more in a soap opera, not a multi-million dollar feature film. The image of a floating necropolis is striking though.Titanic is certainly an oddity. Its a film that people embraced as a whole the world over, and now they go out they're way to find fault with it. I didn't go looking for faults. They surfaced as time went by because it just doesn't hold up too well to repeated viewings. I still think you should see Titanic, even if in a few years it probably won't do for you what it used to.",jame cameron titan noth short phenomenon like mani other went pictur catch mustse film first saw titan swept away whole film thought thrill piec entertain funni reson excit equal measurebut like mani other also feel titan lost bit sparkl year time like ask film held high regard rank low let see answer questionther deni one hand impress piec filmmak cameron direct slick econom someth that serv well sinc extraordinari debut termin hour run time zip without one bare notic somewher along way cameron fumbl like titan film goe handscameron selfprofess titan enthusiast he clearli put great deal thought care precis recreat titan jumbo size piston engin room right tini porthol bow exactingli craft destruct first explain u stepbystep comput simulationth collis iceberg gradual flood compart loss power ship split half eventu sink final see enact last minut would churlish mention eerili precis cameron get detail titanicit shame human charact arent well develop cameron clout industri allow array truli extraordinari cast save one two quit charact littl cardboard cutoutsk winslet shine rose quit well invest great deal resourc spunk part dbutant forc marriag cameron draw lot strength vital charactera leonardo dicaprio bring plenti enthusiasm jack dawson penniless artist steerag romanc rose never truli convinc relationship work simplist term push right emot button exactli struck chord audienc especi femal member rememb hear quit ladi audienc reach tissu jack rather maudlin death scenei couldnt go detail describ mani peopl keep track otherwis id run word one score favour kathi bate unsink molli brown victor garber mr andrew ship builder small memor role jason barri tommi irishman steerag meet tragic enda everyon el theyr onedimension billi zane cast rose fianc cal snobbish control tyrant there depth charact david warner wast thankless role zane ghoulish valet franc fisher take prize worst offend play ruth rose heartless mothercameron wait quit bit actual collis youd forgiven feel littl restless first hour half moment stand quit like way film contrast differ st rd class dinner way definit sit pay attent jack draw rose nude wear noth priceless diamondbut realli crash film final start get interest part stori cameron want tell stage destruct titan breathtak regard corridor flood cascad water enorm hull pivot air terrifi sight scene film hold captiv audienc cameron shoot fanat immediaci watch destruct stylis impecc craft set awesom beholdyet even scene cameron miscu littl sink titan film mani time night rememb influenc cameron first add comedi mix didnt mind much first half peopl aboard didnt know maiden voyag titan doom second half cameron tri make laugh approach odd dramat thrust stori eg aristocrat aboard want brandi ship sink hardli believ behaviour even disrespect memori aboard leav bad tast mouthcameron demonstr far much willing guess peopl aboard like paint unfavour colour portray offic offici bureaucrat even one shoot passeng even evid support thatth final scene jack rose go long opinion final word realli hackney mawkish belong soap opera multimillion dollar featur film imag float necropoli strike thoughtitan certainli odditi film peopl embrac whole world go theyr way find fault didnt go look fault surfac time went doesnt hold well repeat view still think see titan even year probabl wont use,neutral

Even some of the things people say relates right to what actually happened. It does have some minor flaws like how the ship is built, but other than that, I thought it was fairly accurate.Also, the director really connects you with the characters. With Rose, you feel bad for her that she is forced to marry this terrible man and with Jack, you feel bad for him because he keeps getting stereotyped into a ""poor man."" You can tell that they have such a connection right away as well. Towards the beginning, when Rose is on the railing of the ship, Jack comes in and saves her, which brings them closer together. They have an unbreakable bond. At some points in the film, I did get a little teary-eyed from how Rose was treated by her fiancé and mother. It was so unfair that she could never make her own decisions. The same goes with Jack too, when Rose's fiancé and mother would discriminate him because he didn't have nearly as much in his pocket. These examples help you grow fond of the characters and help you feel what they feel.This film is fairly historically accurate and a timeless classic.",truli one best movi ever seen mani littl detail relat actual histori even thing peopl say relat right actual happen minor flaw like ship built thought fairli accuratealso director realli connect charact rose feel bad forc marri terribl man jack feel bad keep get stereotyp poor man tell connect right away well toward begin rose rail ship jack come save bring closer togeth unbreak bond point film get littl tearyey rose treat fianc mother unfair could never make decis goe jack rose fianc mother would discrimin didnt nearli much pocket exampl help grow fond charact help feel feelthi film fairli histor accur timeless classic,positive

163,"Disaster movies might be my favorite genre. There's a simple formula to these movies: the first half hour is the set-up and then the roof caves in. Writer/director/producer James Cameron missed the memo. Cameron takes over an hour and a half to get to the meat and potatoes. It's time wasted. The first half of ""Titanic"" is long and tedious. The bookend story isn't that interesting. The voyage stuff is pure melodrama. The dialogue is corny with way too much ""explaining"". That stuff is informative but it never sounds real. For some reason the strong cast isn't very good either. Overall, they get a grade of C+. It's when ""Titanic"" hits the iceberg that the movie really comes alive. It's exciting and very emotional. The last hour or so is classic. I saw ""Titanic"" twice in the theater. Once when it first came out and the other time was for its 3D re-release.

164,"It all starts off with a 100 year old woman named Rose DeWitt Bukater telling her story full of love and loss. The story takes place on the luxurious, but ill-fated R.M.S. Titanic, with young Rose boarding the departed ship with the upper class passengers and her mother. Meanwhile, a traveler and an artist named Jack Dawson and his best friend Fabrizio win third class tickets to the ship in a game of poker. The story explains a seventeen-year-old noblewomen falling in love with a kind, but poor artist.It is a real life story, with a fictional twist. The movie shows two completely different worlds and how they connect, putting aside the labels and showing the purest of love. A great lesson for the real world. Jack and Rose spend their days together experiencing and learning new things from each other. The tale starts off with young Rose convincing herself to jump off of the ship due to her life situation of being forced to marry a self involved man that only loves money and himself. Jack spots young Rose leaning over the rail and tries to convince her saying ""I went through some thin ice and I'm tellin' ya, water that cold... like that right down there... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body. You can't breath, you can't think... least not about anything but the pain. Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in after you. But like I said, I don't see a choice. I guess I'm kinda hoping you'll come back over the rail and get me off the hook here."" His attempt to help is successful and is invited to a meal as a result of his heroic act.The whole story with the movie is iconic. It has greatly impacted then and is still now. It has made a major impact in the movie industry, and is still evolving. It's a story being told while also being lived at the same time. Now the ship lies at the bottom of the ocean with its remains only able to last another 15 to 20 years, the film is here to keep the memory of the titanic alive. Great success and great things have come out of this movie for many different reasons.I recommend this movie for anyone from teens/young adults to elders. The historic event tying to a beautiful, but fictional story. It's been over 105 years and people are still fascinated with it.

165,"There are a ton of problems in ""Titanic"" – the cartoon villains, the stilted dialog, much of it obviously re-recorded in post production. Some weak supporting performances, the betrayal of a number of historical facts, and taking what was already one of the most dramatic nights of the 20th century and needlessly pumping it up with chases, gunfire, theft, scheming, etc. Yet a lot works. As much as I didn't want to give in, Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio make a great, old fashioned, star crossed romantic couple. Many of the effects and stunts are amazing (although at other times you realize some wide shots are basically giant video-game like cartoons). And it made me cry -- while I felt like a fool for being swept up in it's shameless melodrama. I can't argue that ""Titanic"" is art, or deep, or a great film, but I can say it's a terrifically effective entertainment that everyone should see at least once.",ton problem titan cartoon villain stilt dialog much obvious rerecord post product weak support perform betray number histor fact take alreadi one dramat night th centuri needlessli pump chase gunfir theft scheme etc yet lot work much didnt want give kate winslet leonardo dicaprio make great old fashion star cross romant coupl mani effect stunt amaz although time realiz wide shot basic giant videogam like cartoon made cri felt like fool swept shameless melodrama cant argu titan art deep great film say terrif effect entertain everyon see least,neutral
166,"Reviewed on May 8, 2011.That's not all the movies I've watched today. After rewinding the Grease VHS and ejecting it out my VCR, I put in Titanic, and that was such a long movie. My parents also got this at Blockbuster back in 1998 as well. This is still an emotional movie. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet's performances as Jack and Rose are outstanding, James Cameron's direction is great, the soundtrack is amazing (especially ""My Heart Will Go On"" by Celine Dion), the special effects are well done, and the famous ""I'm the king of the world!"" line is so unforgettable.Titanic is such a masterpiece. This was my favorite 1997 movie, but recently I watched Princess Mononoke and now that is my favorite 1997 movie.Rating: 10/10.",review may that movi ive watch today rewind greas vh eject vcr put titan long movi parent also got blockbust back well still emot movi leonardo dicaprio kate winslet perform jack rose outstand jame cameron direct great soundtrack amaz especi heart go celin dion special effect well done famou im king world line unforgettabletitan masterpiec favorit movi recent watch princess mononok favorit movier,positive

168,"When I was a child I cried, bitterly, when the fat lady (Shelley Winters) bravely dived into the waters in the truly epic 'Poseidon Adventure'. Why? Because the screen playwright and director understood that true human glory is not about special effects, but characterisation.I can't begin to recount the superficiality and shallowness of this dreadful film - where there's absolutely no foundation for genuine affection, much less enduring love. And, worst of all, with his very inapt hands, James Cameron attempted to repeat the cliche of rich girl meets poor boy, which bears no significance whatsoever to the plot(if it can be called one), in which everybody was subject to a violent death, nobleman or peasant.The art of tragedy is a tricky one, but there is one simple rule - make your characters genuine, realistic, and most of all believable, so that the audience will feel what they feel, breathe what they breathe and, in the end, partake in the experience.",child cri bitterli fat ladi shelley winter brave dive water truli epic poseidon adventur screen playwright director understood true human glori special effect characterisationi cant begin recount superfici shallow dread film there absolut foundat genuin affect much le endur love worst inapt hand jame cameron attempt repeat clich rich girl meet poor boy bear signific whatsoev plotif call one everybodi subject violent death nobleman peasantth art tragedi tricki one one simpl rule make charact genuin realist believ audienc feel feel breath breath end partak experi,neutral
169,"An absolutely spellbinding film that still holds up over 20 years later. I first saw this as a 12-year-old in 1997 and recall being utterly captivated by the story, the imagery, the characters, the score and the sheer spectacle of it all. 'Titanic' was an event, not just a film. There was nothing like it before, and there has been nothing like it since.
Leonardo di Caprio and Kate Winslet, both relatively unknown actors at the time of the film's original release, shine as Jack and Rose, two young people from opposite ends of the social spectrum who are brought together by fate against the backdrop of one of history's greatest tragedies. Winslet steals every scene with her portrayal of a deeply unhappy woman thrust into an engagement of convenience at the behest of her domineering mother, only finding happiness and her true self when she crosses paths with di Caprio's Jack Dawson. Tragedy inevitably strikes however, and it becomes a fight for survival as the great ship Titanic founders. For all of the special effects, it is the chemistry between Winslet and di Caprio that drives the film. If you have ever become infatuated with someone in a very short space of time, then it is very easy to relate to the relationship between Jack and Rose. They perfectly capture the intensity of infatuation and the recklessness of youth. Other excellent characters include Billy Zane's charming but abrasive Cal Hockley, Frances Fisher's sneering Ruth Dewitt Bukater and Kathy Bates' bolshy Molly Brown. Finally, the great Gloria Stewart portrays 'old' Rose with such sincerity and heart that it is difficult to believe she didn't live through all of this in real life.",absolut spellbind film still hold year later first saw yearold recal utterli captiv stori imageri charact score sheer spectacl titan event film noth like noth like sinc leonardo di caprio kate winslet rel unknown actor time film origin releas shine jack rose two young peopl opposit end social spectrum brought togeth fate backdrop one histori greatest tragedi winslet steal everi scene portray deepli unhappi woman thrust engag conveni behest domin mother find happi true self cross path di caprio jack dawson tragedi inevit strike howev becom fight surviv great ship titan founder special effect chemistri winslet di caprio drive film ever becom infatu someon short space time easi relat relationship jack rose perfectli captur intens infatu reckless youth excel charact includ billi zane charm abras cal hockley franc fisher sneer ruth dewitt bukat kathi bate bolshi molli brown final great gloria stewart portray old rose sincer heart difficult believ didnt live real life,positive

171,"This movie truly broke my heart. Jack and Rose face great difficulties (her being an aristocrat and him poor) but they still continue to fight fo their love no matter what. We first see an old lady which we later on know is Rose. She sees on the TV the drawing of her that Jack had made when thenews was talking about the Titanic shipwreck. She then goes on to call the news and tell her story.84 years ago on April 10th 1912, 17 year old Rose is on board on the Titanic ship along with her mom, grandma, and fiance, Caledon, (all of who'm were nobelty/aristocrats). Rose feels helpessly trapped by her situation ( marrying her snobby fiancé, Caledon) and tries to commit suicide by hanging off the edge of the deck until she was rescued by Jack. Jack is then invited by Caledon to a dinner amongst the rich in return for his heroic action. He goes through the evening acting his best at being rich. Jack then takes Rose down to the third-classe's party, where they dance endlessly. Shockingly, one of CaLedon's spies had followed them and informed him of his fiance's sneaking around. Rose was intruiged by Jack's drawings and so she asks him to draw her nude wearing the diamond necklace Caledon gave her. Caledon finds out and had plotted against Jack, he falsely accussed him of theft and had him locked away. Not long after, the ship encounters an iceberg which threatens to wreck it apart. Panic overflows the ship as the crew/staff takes safety precautions, giving people life vests. Soon, the lower parts of the ship begin to drown. Jack is in danger and so Rose is in panic to rescue him from the room in which he is in chains in. She manages to get an axe and breaks the chains. The water was almost head-level. They both swim upwards and get to the top of the ship. Boats were getting filled up, women and children going first. Caledon ushers Rose to go in, promising her that Jack was going to be safe. She doesn't believe him and returns back for Jack. Caledon, furious, chases after Jack and Rose with a gun in his hand. Fortunately all his shots miss and they manage to escape to the top of the ship. Caledon soon fakes having a child in order to board a boat. At this point, the Titanic's end was titing upwards at an extreme angles, people were falling off whilst others were lucky enough to clang onto stuff. Jack and Rose hold on to the top of the ship and get ready to dive into the deep, freezing water. Fortunately, Rose;s life vest allowed her to swim a bit more easily, can not say the same for Jck though. Rose clings onto a wooden boards whilst Jack is barely holds on to it. They pass out and by the time help comes, it was way too late... Jack had frozen to death. Unknowing of that fact, Rose tries to shake him awake until she comes into the shocking realization. Jack drops t the deep ocean, his corpse becoming a part of the ocean. She is then rescued by the crew and taken back. All the survivors from the Titanic are saved by the RMS Carpathia.",movi truli broke heart jack rose face great difficulti aristocrat poor still continu fight fo love matter first see old ladi later know rose see tv draw jack made thenew talk titan shipwreck goe call news tell stori year ago april th year old rose board titan ship along mom grandma fianc caledon nobeltyaristocrat rose feel helpessli trap situat marri snobbi fianc caledon tri commit suicid hang edg deck rescu jack jack invit caledon dinner amongst rich return heroic action goe even act best rich jack take rose thirdclass parti danc endlessli shockingli one caledon spi follow inform fianc sneak around rose intruig jack draw ask draw nude wear diamond necklac caledon gave caledon find plot jack fals accuss theft lock away long ship encount iceberg threaten wreck apart panic overflow ship crewstaff take safeti precaut give peopl life vest soon lower part ship begin drown jack danger rose panic rescu room chain manag get axe break chain water almost headlevel swim upward get top ship boat get fill woman child go first caledon usher rose go promis jack go safe doesnt believ return back jack caledon furiou chase jack rose gun hand fortun shot miss manag escap top ship caledon soon fake child order board boat point titan end tite upward extrem angl peopl fall whilst other lucki enough clang onto stuff jack rose hold top ship get readi dive deep freez water fortun rose life vest allow swim bit easili say jck though rose cling onto wooden board whilst jack bare hold pas time help come way late jack frozen death unknow fact rose tri shake awak come shock realiz jack drop deep ocean corp becom part ocean rescu crew taken back survivor titan save rm carpathia,positive

The grandeur of the Titanic is expertly portrayed, and the film's recreation of the ship's interiors and exteriors is nothing short of stunning.

Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet have incredible chemistry on screen, and their performances are emotionally charged and nuanced. Their portrayal of two people from different worlds who fall in love despite the odds is touching and heartbreaking.In addition to the romance, the film also features strong supporting performances from a talented ensemble cast that includes Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, and Frances Fisher.Titanic is a timeless classic that continues to resonate with audiences today. Its stunning visuals, expertly crafted story, and powerful performances make it a cinematic masterpiece that is sure to be remembered for generations to come.

173,"Has the world gone utterly mad? ""Titanic"" is the best/greatest/most wonderfullest movie of all time? Nooooooooooo!Come on, people, let's get a few things straight.First the good news: (1) ""Titanic"" had lovely (and seemingly accurate) costuming, (2) beautiful sets, (3) first-rate special effects (okay, let's call the F/X spectacular), and (4) a gorgeous musical score. Overall, I was so touched at the end of the movie that my eyes were filled with tears (for some strange reason my wife finds my sentimentality amusing).Now the bad news: (1) the scripting was awful (some of the dialogue that came out of the characters' mouths made me winch with pain), (2) the characterizations were weak and predictable (there was no doubt as to who were the good guys and who were the bad guys. All the good guys were totally good, all the bad guys were totally bad. If you ever want to see a person who has both good AND evil qualities all you need to do is look in the mirror: it's called human nature), (3) some scenes can only be described as vulgar Disneyesque (who can forget that romantic ""I'll jump your bones you in the back of the car number?"" Oh, and let's not forget the hand running down the window, now that was touching), (4) blame the script all you want, but the acting was weak, and finally, (5) one of the worst scenes in a motion picture: the infamous ""I'll teach you how to spit"" scene. That was in such bad taste. With the possible exception of really uncouth adolescents, who could watch that scene and not be repelled?Okay, now that I've gotten that off my chest I feel so much better.To conclude, no, ""Titanic"" was NOT the best movie of all time, nor was it the worst. It's a must-see movie, no doubt about it. It is a great movie if you like black-and-white characters with a color-by-numbers story line. Unfortunately if you demand complex characters, solid acting, and credible plots you will be sorely disappointed.",world gone utterli mad titan bestgreatestmost wonderfullest movi time nooooooooooocom peopl let get thing straightfirst good news titan love seemingli accur costum beauti set firstrat special effect okay let call fx spectacular gorgeou music score overal touch end movi eye fill tear strang reason wife find sentiment amusingnow bad news script aw dialogu came charact mouth made winch pain character weak predict doubt good guy bad guy good guy total good bad guy total bad ever want see person good evil qualiti need look mirror call human natur scene describ vulgar disneyesqu forget romant ill jump bone back car number oh let forget hand run window touch blame script want act weak final one worst scene motion pictur infam ill teach spit scene bad tast possibl except realli uncouth adolesc could watch scene repelledokay ive gotten chest feel much betterto conclud titan best movi time worst mustse movi doubt great movi like blackandwhit charact colorbynumb stori line unfortun demand complex charact solid act credibl plot sore disappoint,neutral

175,"Titanic, a film that led us to believe we were about to witness the greatest cinematic masterpiece of all time. Spoiler alert: it wasn't.First, let's address the overexposure and overhype that continue to haunt our nightmares. Remember when My Heart Will Go On played on every radio station and in every mall, and we couldn't escape the tragic love story of Jack and Rose even if we tried? It's as if Titanic was the only ship to ever sink or the only love story ever told. Instead of a respectful historical drama, we got a melodramatic love story that would make daytime soap operas look like high art.Speaking of melodrama, let's not forget the ""iconic"" love story between Jack and Rose. Who could resist a ""forbidden"" romance that's as fresh as a 100-year-old can of beans? Jack is a penniless artist because, of course, all artists are secretly charming rebels who win over rich, uptight girls. Then there's Rose, the rich, uptight girl who's clearly in dire need of saving from her diamond-clad life. It's essentially a love story that makes you wonder if a shipwreck was the only way these two could meet, because where else could a poor guy and a rich girl fall in love other than on a doomed ship? And as the ship sinks, we're treated to an hours-long disaster sequence that makes you wish you were drowning just to escape the melodrama. Jack and Rose's romance is like a never-ending crying contest, complete with cheesy dialogue and longing gazes. Their ""I'm the king of the world!"" moment was about as subtle as a sledgehammer, and their tragic farewell in the icy depths was enough to make anyone scream, ""I'll never let go!"" Ugh.Titanic may have won countless awards, but it's a cinematic iceberg that'll leave you feeling colder than the North Atlantic Ocean. In retrospect, the film and its soundtrack have aged about as gracefully as a rusted anchor. The haunting refrain of My Heart Will Go On is like nails on a chalkboard, but with extra cheese. The once epic and emotional scenes now probably just make you cringe; a cringe goes on and on. It's outdated, cheesy, and so overly dramatic. The film has become a relic of a bygone era that should have stayed buried in the depths of the ocean.",titan film led u believ wit greatest cinemat masterpiec time spoiler alert wasntfirst let address overexposur overhyp continu haunt nightmar rememb heart go play everi radio station everi mall couldnt escap tragic love stori jack rose even tri titan ship ever sink love stori ever told instead respect histor drama got melodramat love stori would make daytim soap opera look like high artspeak melodrama let forget icon love stori jack rose could resist forbidden romanc that fresh yearold bean jack penniless artist cours artist secretli charm rebel win rich uptight girl there rose rich uptight girl who clearli dire need save diamondclad life essenti love stori make wonder shipwreck way two could meet el could poor guy rich girl fall love doom ship ship sink treat hourslong disast sequenc make wish drown escap melodrama jack rose romanc like neverend cri contest complet cheesi dialogu long gaze im king world moment subtl sledgehamm tragic farewel ici depth enough make anyon scream ill never let go ughtitan may countless award cinemat iceberg thatll leav feel colder north atlant ocean retrospect film soundtrack age grace rust anchor haunt refrain heart go like nail chalkboard extra chees epic emot scene probabl make cring cring goe outdat cheesi overli dramat film becom relic bygon era stay buri depth ocean,positive

This is the BEST movie and GREATEST love story I've ever seen. This movie really got me in my feelings. They could not have chosen anyone better than Leonardo DiCaprio( he is gorgeous) and Kate Winslet to play jack and rose. They played those characters with so much heart and feeling that it almost seemed like real life. You could tell they really gave it their all and I cried like a baby at the end. And the music My heart will go on by Celine Dion was the PERFECT song for this movie. It just really moves you.

177,"Titanic' was quite the phenomenon when it came out. There is no movie that I can think of, at least in my lifetime, that became the cultural event that it did. There were many concerns within the film community that the film was going to be a disaster. James Cameron had spent a long time finishing the film and it was the most costly film ever made. Many people thought it was bring an end to his career. All these concerns and predictions were shattered when 'Titanic' came out; it became the highest grossing movie ever and it won more Academy awards than any other movie. It skyrocketed the careers of both Kate Winslet and Leo DiCaprio. I went to the theaters to see it with family and friends. It was an incredible experience and several people around me were crying. There were very few movies I had ever seen before that had mesmerized me as much as this movie did.I watched this movie in its entirety for the first time in years. The reaction is much different now and the film seems much less impressive. First of all, the graphics in 'Titanic' have not aged well. When the ship is sinking, the CGIs look really fake and dated. Also, the model ship they used doesn't look very good either. It looks cheap and like it was made out of plastic! This does not surprise me because most films do not age well; a new generation of film lovers will not find certain films as impressive as the last generation. Putting that aside, the story of 'Titanic' is not that bad. I think most people know what the story is about so I do not need to explain it. The acting is slightly above average, but the screenplay is so clichéd and corny, I can understand the acting did not need to be that impressive. The last forty minutes of the film consists of the two main characters shouting, ""Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack! Rose, Rose, Rose, Rose!"" They must love each other so much that they can't think of anything else to say.I don't think 'Titanic' is destined to become a classic. Even though it made so much money and won so many awards, I think most people now see the movie as an embarrassment. Now that I am older and wiser, 'Titanic' just seems like a mediocre film. Pretty disappointing considering how much the movie was loved when it first came out.",titan quit phenomenon came movi think least lifetim becam cultur event mani concern within film commun film go disast jame cameron spent long time finish film costli film ever made mani peopl thought bring end career concern predict shatter titan came becam highest gross movi ever academi award movi skyrocket career kate winslet leo dicaprio went theater see famili friend incred experi sever peopl around cri movi ever seen mesmer much movi didi watch movi entireti first time year reaction much differ film seem much le impress first graphic titan age well ship sink cgi look realli fake date also model ship use doesnt look good either look cheap like made plastic surpris film age well new gener film lover find certain film impress last gener put asid stori titan bad think peopl know stori need explain act slightli averag screenplay clichd corni understand act need impress last forti minut film consist two main charact shout jack jack jack jack rose rose rose rose must love much cant think anyth el sayi dont think titan destin becom classic even though made much money mani award think peopl see movi embarrass older wiser titan seem like mediocr film pretti disappoint consid much movi love first came,positive

179,"The true reason that Jack has to die doesn't lie in the physics of surviving in very cold water, but in the inner logic of the story. Jack has to die because he exists in order to empower Rose and give her the will to live. And once that story purpose is fulfilled, he's gone.I think we tend to fixate on the insanely iconic romance scenes and the sinking of the ship. But a big focus of the actual movie is on the theme of finding the will to live. From Roses perspective, it's as if Jack conveniently springs into existence precisely when she needs him to stop her from ending her life and reveal to her a better way out of her misery. The moment that Jack dies is also the moment when Rose finally commits wholeheartedly to not dying. Jack teaches Rose to keep the fire going within her to rekindle in her the desire to live.Before the Titanic hits the iceberg, money, expressed as the classes onboard, seems all-important, especially to the people in first class. But when we're facing down death, all the riches in the world are suddenly revelled to be worthless. The move illustrates this perfectly when Cal tries to bride First officer Murdoch for a seat on the lifeboat. But Murdoch is about to die; so what use is money to him? Therefore if your ship is going down what does it matter what class you're going to die in? Near the end of the movie, we're told Cal commits suicide after losing much of his money in the Crash of 29. So because Cal cant understand that money really isn't everything, it's as if he never actually learns what the value of life is. When the older rose throws the heart of the ocean into the water at the end, she's again rejecting Cal's value system and the idea that wealth matters anywhere near as much as those inner, spiritual things that drive us. So Rose is giving the heart of the ocean back to Jack and recognizing the way that he resorted her heart to her - helping her find the fire within that she needed to live this long, full life.Rose appears at the start to be the ""damsel in distress' type. But it quickly becomes clear that Rose is our real hero - she's the one who undergoes a complete transformation, and this is her story. Jack exists to service Rose's story. Jack purpose in Titanic is to enable Rose's character growth. Jack has given her all the tools necessary for her survival, so his role in the story is complete. And that, essentially is why he has to die at the end. Not because he can't fit on the door but because the story has no more use for him. In the later story, the crew searching for the diamond tell us they didn't find anything on Jack and there's no record of him. The story gives us an excuse for this - Jack won his ticket last minute in a poker game. But it seems intentional that the movie plants the tiniest seed of doubt as to whether Jack was really on the ship after all. At the end of Rose's life. Jacks memory is completely erased from the world, except for the indelible impact he's left on her - so he's alive only in her heart. It's a bit of a stretch to read Titanic as Rose's romance with a guy who's totally imaginary - of course, many others interact with Jack. But the point is that jack has a subtle air of unreality about him... he feels like some fantasy of a sexy life-coach that every girl needs from time to time to help her reorient her heart in the right direction.Jack is the piece of her that's missing. A woman getting in touch with her animus (Masculine Side) often involves finding strength of will and determination to act. These are things that historically, society hasn't really encouraged in women (espeically in 1912). But as soon as Rose merges with Jack, her animus, she becomes daring and holds, her own woman. In an incredibly accelerated timeline, she ditches her fiance and turns her back on her family and social class. Rose shows sexual agency, too, actively pursuing Jack in their romance. And after she has sex with Jack, Rose is assertive, holding and comforting him. When she arrives on the other shore, she assumes a new name in a new country. Taking his last name is a symbolic commitment to Jack, representing the idea that in her secret mind, she is forever married to him. But if we say that he's her animus her ""marriage' to this piece of herself would symbolize a promise that she'll never abandon her own agency and will again. Jacks death can be read as the moment when her animus ceases to be something sperate from her - and the result is Rose Dawson.So as much as our culture remembers Titanic for the romance, fittingly the deepest theme of this movie about so many tragic deaths is finding the will to live. In order for Rose to recapture her will to live, she needs to honestly face what's wrong in her life and cut that out. Committing to being alive means committing to living authentically as oneself.Great movie that sill holds up all these years.

181,"Titanic is one of the best films both by James Cameron and in history in general for obvious reasons. It is a story of romance and tragedy that knew how to portray well the tragedy that occurred in Atlantic.

182,"Titanic is a movie I've seen countless times since I was a little kid and it came out. This movie is one that seems to polarize people to extremes. Some love it and will call it one of the best movies they've seen and others will hate it and label it one of the worst. As far as where I stand on it today, I still believe it is a very good film that benefits from marvelous special effects. Jack wins his way onto the Titanic in a poker game and runs into first class rich girl, Rose, when she is hanging off the end of the ship, apparently about to commit suicide. Jack saves her and they start spending a lot of time together, which really pisses off Rose's rich, but unpleasant fiancé, Cal Hockley. The story is told by the 102 year old Rose, as treasure seeker Brock Lovett searches for a diamond that was given to Rose by Cal on the boat. The movie has its share of problems. The dialogue, at times, can be corny, as can the actions. The acting, while serviceable most of the time, has some terrible moments, especially from Billy Zane and Bill Paxton. Also, the film suffers slightly from its long run time. It's not something that bothers me a great deal, but had the film been cut by something like 20 or 30 minutes, it would have flowed a lot better. Titanic isn't James Cameron's best film, but it is a majestic and epic one. I like Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as Jack and Rose, and I also really liked Kathy Bates as a first class passenger that has just come into her money. This isn't one of the best films ever, but it's, at times, fun, sad, infuriating, and joyful. There's an emotional roller-coaster going on here.",titan movi ive seen countless time sinc littl kid came movi one seem polar peopl extrem love call one best movi theyv seen other hate label one worst far stand today still believ good film benefit marvel special effect jack win way onto titan poker game run first class rich girl rose hang end ship appar commit suicid jack save start spend lot time togeth realli piss rose rich unpleas fianc cal hockley stori told year old rose treasur seeker brock lovett search diamond given rose cal boat movi share problem dialogu time corni action act servic time terribl moment especi billi zane bill paxton also film suffer slightli long run time someth bother great deal film cut someth like minut would flow lot better titan isnt jame cameron best film majest epic one like leonardo dicaprio kate winslet jack rose also realli like kathi bate first class passeng come money isnt one best film ever time fun sad infuri joy there emot rollercoast go,positive
183,"I attended this movie prepared to see a another blockbuster rip-off. There have been many. Disappointing run of the mill stuff, each like the other in content and movement. From the start this movie was different. What impressed me the most was the accurate detail involved in both the sets and the telling of the story. It's central story about two lovers destined to be torn apart by events taking place around them, is never boring. More important is the telling of the ship's disaster itself.With breathtaking special effects the movie viewer is brought onto the ship and made to feel a part of the on-going action. Mr. Cameron has given us a closer look than we have ever had, or probably ever will have, at what happened that fateful night of it's sinking. To coin a term from another well made movie on the subject, it is truly, ""Ä Night To Remember.""Thanks to James Cameron caring and skill and excellent performances all around, this is a picture to be proud of, and a tribute to an event that should never be forgotten in the annals of history.",attend movi prepar see anoth blockbust ripoff mani disappoint run mill stuff like content movement start movi differ impress accur detail involv set tell stori central stori two lover destin torn apart event take place around never bore import tell ship disast itselfwith breathtak special effect movi viewer brought onto ship made feel part ongo action mr cameron given u closer look ever probabl ever happen fate night sink coin term anoth well made movi subject truli night rememberthank jame cameron care skill excel perform around pictur proud tribut event never forgotten annal histori,positive
184,"Much of the 3D conversion in the earlier part of the film looked phony and actually detracted from the story. The images looked like multiple 2D layers pasted at different distances and each layer looked flat and lacked depth, making for an incongruous and distracting image, unlike a film shot with a twin lens camera to begin with.Later scenes, shot at greater distances where the 3D effect was more subtle, were more effective and sometimes quite stunning.(Note, review policy demands that I have at least ten lines of text. I didn't want to repeat any of the previous comments about this movie, there are over 2000 messages, good and bad, about the story. All I needed to say was in the first eight lines.

185,"I had few problems with this film, and I have heard a lot of criticisms saying it is overlong and overrated. True, it is over three hours long, but I was amazed that it goes by so quickly. I don't think it is overrated at all, I think the IMDb rating is perfectly decent. The film looks sumptuous, with gorgeous costumes and excellent effects, and the direction from James Cameron rarely slips from focus. Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his best performances as Jack, and Kate Winslet is lovely as Rose. David Warner, a great actor, steals every scene he's in. The story is very rich in detail, and is hot on character development, obvious with the love story which is very moving when it needs to be, though in the first bit of the movie it is a little slow. The last hour is extremely riveting, and I will confess that I was on the edge of my seat, when the Titanic sank. I will also say that the last five minutes were very moving. The music score by James Horner was lovely, though I never was a huge fan of the song My Heart will Go On. The 1996 miniseries was good, but suffered from undeveloped scenarios and some historical inaccuracies. Overall, I give Titanic an 8.5/10.

186,"I went to see this movie after hearing only rave reviews and good things about it.  I thought it must be an unbelievable movie.  I was in for a surprise...Many people still believe that Titanic is the best film ever made.  It's not a particularly bad film...the acting is good and it's arguably well directed. The first half of the movie, the set up of the love triangle, is semi-interesting, but then the second half is different.  They try to make you really care about Jack and Rose and want them to live through the inevitable sinking of the ship.  (That's one thing that bothers me about true stories: you already know what's going to happen...)  The acting was decent, but the characters were not written deeply enough for me to really care whether or not they die.  The second half of the movie is the ship sinking.  Amazing effects on this half.  I guess it did a good job of showing how horrible it must have been to be there, and it was meant to be suspenseful and maybe even scary, but I actually got bored.  The audience was already aware that a lot of people were going to die, but the movie spends about an hour showing the many different ways the sinking of the Titanic could have killed someone.  I remember watching the Academy Awards and thinking, ""Well, Titanic is going to win,"" and everyone else already knew this, but almost everyone agrees with the Academy's choice.  There were many great movies that year: L.A. Confidential and Good Will Hunting were both better movies than this was, in my opinion.  Titanic just didn't hold my interest the way many, many other movies have.  So if you are easily impressed and not a big movie watcher, then you'll probably enjoy this movie.

187,"When you have a film this big and successful, it just stands to reason that a number of people are going to try to bash it. Especially when it happens to be a romance. And sure enough, I am the only male I know who has anything positive at all to say about it. Is all of the criticism warranted? Let's see...Jim Cameron didn't need to create this huge-scale, heavily detailed historical drama to prove to me he was a great director. This film did pretty much convince the rest of the movie-going world, though. We all know the story of this great luxury liner sinking to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean on that chilly April evening in 1912. The substantial loss of life still ranks among the great human tragedies of recent history (9/11, Pearl Harbor, etc). Cameron spared no cost of either time or money to make the ship and its furnishings look exactly as they would have on that maiden voyage. In terms of technical detail, this film is without peer.
The cast is generally appealing. Leo DiCaprio is far from a world-class actor, but his enthusiastic and earnest portrayal of Jack Dawson couldn't have been done better. Kate Winslet looks right in her element as a pampered young debutant trying to brake away from her boring life consisting of endless dinners and tea parties. Kathy Bates as ""The Unsinkable Molly Brown"" is always likeable and the rest of the cast (mostly Brits) does a good job of filling out their respective roles of cast and crew. Billy Zane gives the film's best performance as Winslet's greedy, snobbish fiancee. He is one of our most underrated actors. And you have to love David Warner as his bodyguard/enforcer.   As far as the special effects go, it's hard to imagine the sinking of the ship could have been filmed any better. Each time you view it, you seem to get a different perspective of just how lucky any of those passengers were to survive not only the actual sinking, but waiting around in life boats for help to arrive. As of this writing, only three known survivors are still alive. One can only imagine how many countless hours it took to conceive of, shoot, and edit the last hour of the film. The results are terrific.There are flaws in the overall mix, however. Some of the dialogue (Mostly Leo's) is down right corny. ""When you've got nothing, you've got nothing to lose!"" or ""You seem like kind of an indoor girl"" are two examples. Also, the notion that a guy from steerage class could go up and mingle with the first class passengers under any circumstances is not plausable. Keep in mind that a first class ticket on Titanic in today's economy would go for $80,000! These were some RICH people, and they wouldn't have let a guy like Dawson near them.Anyone who watches this film will have to endure numerous scenes of sappy romance. This film is a romance above all else. Just tough it out if it bothers you. It's not that bad.This film is tragic, exciting, sensual, pretentious, corny, extravagant, and even a little cheesy.

188,"So, bit of backstory for me and this movie. When I was but a wee moviegoer my birthday came around and there were two big movies playing: Titanic and Flubber. At that age? I wanted to see Flubber, hands down, no question. We saw Titanic. Ever since then, I've had something of an unfair distaste for this one but recently I thought, ""It's been years, Cameron made it... I need to give it a fair chance.""Well, I can comfortably say that while I don't think it's for me, I was unfair to this as a child. It really lives up to the Cameron pedigree of being just absolutely gorgeous. The way he made that ship feel, the size of it, the grandeur is just the kind of master craft we come to expect of the man. The cast deliver solid performances throughout, there's a proper sense of drama, even though we all know how it's going to play out.Where it loses me is in the over-the-top nature of the love story. It feels like he's going for a Shakespearean, Romeo and Juliet type of romance epic and I just can't help but feel it's over the top. Beyond that, I could really do without the whole modern aspect of the story. I just feel like it slows stuff down and doesn't really bring anything to the story.Whelp, child me was wrong. This is a pretty solid movie, stunning to look at but is a little too cloying for my tastes still. I will no longer actively avoid it, won't flip the channel if it happens to be on.

189,"Special effects junkies may get something out of this film, but I found it long, very boring and totally unmoving.  The characters in general were shallow and one-dimensional;  none of the main characters were in the slightest bit likeable, and the film's potential was ruined by the extremely silly and totally fabricated central story of the ""upstairs/downstairs"" romance between Di Caprio and Winslett.  This totally implausible bit of the plot succeeds in turning this tale of a terrible human tragedy into just another trite Hollywoodisation in which only beautiful people and thwarted love count for much.

190,"This is EXACTLY what I think: It annoys me when people say they don't like this movie. Yes, it might not be a masterpiece but this was a damn good cinematic achievement. Ben-Hur has a higher rating than this and it's about a man and his encounter with Jesus. If they have an epic with Jesus mentioned that is IN the IMDb top 250, then they should have this movie in the Top 250. This was a very realistic movie. Yes, James Cameron might have stretched some issues but they are very plausible.I always tear up when the music gets intense (anyone who has seen this, will know what I mean) or when I hear the Academy Award winning song that was in this movie (My Heart Will Go On) I tear up. This is the ONLY movie that has made me cry. I don't think I'll find another epic like this that'll make me cry.I've watched about 3/4 of all the movies in the Top 250 and at the very least HALF of them are unworthy of the place they are in. Hell, about a third of what I watched ought not to be on this list but maybe 150 places above the Bottom 100 and that's me being nice.People just have to watch this movie with ABSOLUTELY NO BIASED OPINION or preconceived notion that they heard it was bad. That's how I came to love it. It's now my favorite movie of all time.The effects are the best I've seen since the epics of the 50s. The acting was brilliant and Gloria Stuart should have won Best Supporting Actress for Old Rose. Hell, Kathy Bates should have grabbed a nomination at least. Not a win, but just a nomination. Maybe Victor Garber should have gotten a nomination for Best Supporting Actor. The same with Jonathan Hyde. That's how believable I think this was. The second movie to win 11 Oscars in cinematic history and THE highest grossing movie of all time. This ought to be right up there in the ratings with Ben-Hur.People have to think twice about the rating they gave it and give it a higher rating. That's my opinion.

191,"There is no doubt that James Cameron is capable of putting out fantastic cinema. The man just seems to have a feel for what will pull on the emotions and his eye for scene setting has no equal. Some spoilers ahead.I recently re-watched this on video, on a small TV, and it still blew me away. Action fans will, of course, be disappointed. Perhaps this even qualifies as a chick-flick. I don't know, and don't care. It's just a great movie and never drags even at over three hours.I've tried hard to find niggles, to be impartial, but the only things I can point to are a couple of instances where the special effects were bad (at the beginning, where the bow of the sunken Titanic looks exactly like what it is....a model) and later where Jack and Rose are on the the foredeck and the camera is looking back toward the superstructure (where the scenery looks like the backdrop from a school play). Other than these, the story and effects are fantastic and enhance the film rather than overpowering it.I always cry at the end, with the old lady's scenes of returning to the ship. This is one of a very few movies that do make me cry. For that reason it will always be a favourite.",doubt jame cameron capabl put fantast cinema man seem feel pull emot eye scene set equal spoiler aheadi recent rewatch video small tv still blew away action fan cours disappoint perhap even qualifi chickflick dont know dont care great movi never drag even three hoursiv tri hard find niggl imparti thing point coupl instanc special effect bad begin bow sunken titan look exactli like isa model later jack rose foredeck camera look back toward superstructur sceneri look like backdrop school play stori effect fantast enhanc film rather overpow iti alway cri end old ladi scene return ship one movi make cri reason alway favourit,neutral

194,"James Francis Cameron's Titanic is a well done film, but I think it gets more credit than it deserves.  True, the film won eleven Academy awards (including 3 for Cameron and 2 for composer James Horner), but I think it shouldn't had been ranked so high- like with Ben-Hur status.If you don't know the story of Titanic now, your probably one of the ones who didn't survive because the story is world-renoun.  So are it's actors (Leonardo DiCaprio is not at his best, Kate Winslet is at least hot, and Billy Zane works as a villain) who work into Jim Cameron's script about romance on the high seas.  Luckily, the film doesn't go as slow as you may think, but still, that's no excuse to have the Titanic sinking in the movie longer than it did in  real life.But seriously, this film does have many great qualitites.  The story is well lay out, and the special effects are dazzling (it actually looks like the Titanic is sinking) which also won a Oscar.  One of the great points in this film is the score by James Horner which is his best and one of the best ever, but that is over-shadowed by fancy fireworks and bad acting.  Good direction though.

203,"So aside from its sweeping spectacle and moving depiction of real-life tragedy, what does the story of Jack and Rose bring to the table? In spite of how persuasive the film is, one must remember - it's ultimately a work of fiction, not a documentary. Like any period drama, it is an interpretation of how society worked at the time. Jack and Rose, as well as being beautifully played by DiCaprio and Winslet, are incredibly well crafted. They are a window into a much more subtle form of racism, which is still prevalent today. It's called class, and in the latter half of the movie, it becomes a tool with which to decide who lives and who dies.First of all, just look at this film. The resplendent wonder of the film's set design, both interior and exterior, places you right on board. It looks and feels the part. And when the inevitable disaster strikes, Cameron grabs onto you and drags you through each painful moment in striking detail. The sinking of the Titanic is brought to life with exquisite attention to detail and astonishing visual effects. It makes for the greatest disaster scenes in any movie I've seen.Titanic has pretty much anything you can ask for. It's a romance; it's a disaster movie; it's an action film; it's got a sense of humour and wit; it's a period drama; it's a tragedy. Summed up, Titanic is about as perfect a cinematic experience as you're ever likely to get.The performances just take your breathe away. Jack and Rose's love story is so full of life and heart and what true love should be even if it's a battle or your not the same class and can't be together ounce you find your soulmate that's what love is about. Their characters felt so human and that really is what puts this movie at a whole new level. The camerawork is some of the best I have ever seen in any film. I don't even want to spoil how thrilling, chilling, beautifully well done the Titanic sinking part of the film is because it is something you just have to see for yourself and experience the devastating heartbreaking tragedy that occurred.So as much as our culture remembers Titanic for the romance, fittingly the deepest theme of this movie about so many tragic deaths is finding the will to live. In order for Rose to recapture her will to live, she needs to honestly face what's wrong in her life and cut that out.

There's either a rich boy and poor girl, or a rich girl and poor boy. The ship sinks. One of them dies. Right?"" There are so many great real stories to be told of the Titanic, why do almost all film makers feel compelled to invent a contrived, maudlin story line?Of course, unlike her friend, my granddaughter already knew the stories of the Strausses, Wallace Hartley, John Astor, Benjamin Guggenheim, Molly Brown, and so many others.If James Cameron had simply chosen to use all his skill and special effects budget to tell the sort of honest story told in ""A Night To Remember"", it would've been an all-time great.

206,"After reading the other comments, I was glad there is such a common consent and unanimity on the fact that the part about the ship was good while the plot, particularly the love story, was naive and boring.   Even the dialogue is interesting and relatively witty in the parts about the ship and the characters other than Jack and Rose, while all conversation between the two lovers is boring and naive.  I am surprised there wasn't much effort in creating a more mature and deeper love story, especially with the effort put in the movie as a whole.  James Cameron  did a very good job directing the ship and her sinking, characters like Moly Brown were amusing but there was nothing special about the main characters.  I wonder what was behind the choice of Leonardo DiCaprio for that role, given his young look (One expected a more mature looking man).

Let's face it, if DiCaprio isn't in the cast, this movie doesn't break the records. The performances were all half-way decent at best (I could have played Jack, it was that difficult of a part). But the special effects were nice. The plot was textbook romance and there was nothing surprising, even when Jack died. All in all, this movie was ok. I give it a 6 out of 10. If you want to see a real Cameron movie see ""True Lies"". That's a movie that has got it all. Fun, action, comedy, and a surprise here and there. Finally the main reason this movie could have been better is if the screenplay was better. ""Good Will Hunting"" won for best screenplay in '97 and they deserved it a lot more.

209,"In many ways Titanic is a great movie. The effects are realistic enough to let you get right into it and the performances are generally very good; especially the gorgeous Kate who convinces with, or without, her kit on. It is a story of an ill fated but grand love affair. An unhappy heiress falls for a lovely poor guy over the rich, handsome, total bastard she's engaged to and trouble inevitably follows. This epic story is played out against the backdrop of a ship sinking which adds to the emotion, poignancy, hysteria and general tearfulness of it all and therein lies my problem with this flick.Before Titanic was a film it was a ship. Many real people died. Their families still remember. (yes even a century later), This movie is not a tribute or an insult. It is a disregarding of their memory. Jack and Rose could have had their moment in any one of a thousand scenarios. Why sully this tragic event?The sinking of the Titanic is a great historical tragedy. Not only death, but needless death, plus the loss of a magnificent machine, which was a tribute to human endeavour and ingenuity. The folly of her reckless handling in dangerous waters ( That's the ship, not Kate). The stupidity of man's ""unsinkable"" challenge to nature. The struggle of the crew to save as many people (especially rich ones) as possible. What a great film that could be (they tried to make it in 1958). A story that respected every gasp for air, every self sacrifice, every bloody engineer. Why did we need Jack and Rose?

You feel the true journey of the ship and not just it's final moments above water. Leo and Kate are great in this. King Kathy bates is also perfect. The set, costumes, make up, music, visuals/cinematography, directing all wonderful. It's a great classic film that presents itself as powerful as the ship appeared to be. Even though the ending isn't what a Leo fan girl wants it does allow you to feel more of what the survivors feel wondering if their loved ones survived or if they knew they hadn't. James Cameron is always ambitious with his films but this one is distinguishing. Not the best love story ever but defiantly an iconic one.

211,"Titanic, is a movie about love, the dramatic Titanic sink, difference between the rich and the poor and how people are only thinking about themselves. The movie is perfect in any way, including the acting, action, plot, camera-filming and much, much more. This is the first time I am watching Titanic, and I am impressed that this movie was better than I expected. In this movie, the rich and the poor people, for different reasons, are traveling from England to New York with Titanic. This is also based on true story, by the way. They are showing the romance of a rich girl and a poor boy, that they are loving each other, but it is difficult when the two stages of richdom are combining each other. When the catastrophe begins, you can see how the rich people only cared about themselves, not the others. The characters where played very well, including Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet) it was a fantastic duo in this movie, and the rest of the characters where also played well and they made a great expression. James Cameron is making most of his movies great, very long movies usually, but he is still using the time well and not wasting it like some directors like to do.

214,"So much has been said about Titanic that it's hard to come up with anything new. Some people claim it's the greatest thing ever directed, others say one is too high of a rating. I fit in the middle. This movie had beautiful setting and scenery, some gorgeous shots of the ocean and the sunset. Three thumbs up to those who shot those scenes. And this movie DID have a plot, it didn't need to be three hours long, but non the less it was present. Titanic was a tragedy and this movie was not a celebration of it, it tried to put a story to it which it did. Although the characters were fictional, perhaps stories of the sort did happen (certainly not as dramatic though).Characters could of been a little more developed because with the exception of Sally Brown they were all black and white. I personally really liked the reactions of different people to what was happening on the ship. Nobility of the captain, mother's prayers, musicians attitude etc. Cameron very well portrayed those people.Something was missing from the plot however, it in a way lacked emotions. As I watching this movie, I realized that what was happening on that ship was awful, but I didn't get a sense of reality from it. I didn't feel the horror to the bones and I certainly didn't feel the pain of those people who were drowning. I mean, I knew it was there, I just didn't experience everything they did emotionally, and a good movie should make a person do that.I don't think this movie deserved an Oscar but it still deserved attention as a good movie with imperfections.

215,"In the past, I was unable to comprehend Jack; I always assumed that he was a romantic lad with liberal ideas who enjoyed leading an unrestrained life. The maxim ""To make each day count"" appealed to me because I desired adventure and independence. There is no purpose in focusing only on love because life is harsh and not a haven for those looking for pleasure. Thinking back on the entire movie, Jack's words and deeds eventually made it clear to me that he is the one who knows the most about love and life. He was the one who taught Rose how to love and live her life to the fullest. In addition to being Rose's lover, Jack Dawson served as her spiritual supporter. He cared for her until she was grey and helped her recall when she was unable to walk anymore: ""There was a man named Jack Dawson, and that he saved me in every way that a person can be saved.""",past unabl comprehend jack alway assum romant lad liber idea enjoy lead unrestrain life maxim make day count appeal desir adventur independ purpos focus love life harsh look pleasur think back entir movi jack word deed eventu made clear one know love life one taught rose love live life fullest addit rose lover jack dawson serv spiritu support care grey help recal unabl walk anymor man name jack dawson save everi way person save,positive
216,"At first glance, Titanic is an epic film. The scenery and cinematogrpahy are spectacular, and it is just a beautifully photographed movie. However, when you look past the superficial beauty of the film, much like Armageddon, its numerous shortcomings become clear. First of all, Titanic suffered badly from the transition from the big screen to video. This took away a lot of the hugeness of the film, and this inadvertently places more attention on the story and the acting, both of which were the biggest problems with the film. I went to see this movie to see the sinking of the Titanic, not to see some elaborately fabricated love story. Titanic is a landmark film as a result of the sinking of the ship and the fact that it inexplicably turned out to be such a huge moneymaker. There is absolutely nothing great about the acting, the story is nothing that hasn't been seen dozens of times before, and the directing is awkward, probably due to the fact that James Cameron, who is an excellent director, is so used to directing the Frankenstein-like Schwarzenegger as the Terminator. This is not to say that the directing was bad, it wasn't at all, but there is nothing special to be said about the directing because James Cameron is not really a director of this type of film.Kate Winslet was beautiful in Titanic. She delivered a wonderful performance in the film and was very convincing, as was Kathy Bates (as always) and even Billy Zane. I normally don't like him, but he was playing a dislikeable character, which is probably why I enjoyed his performance so much. Leonardo DiCaprio, however, delivered the worst performance of his career. If you want to see him really act, watch The Basketball Diaries or, even better, The Beach. Titanic is a beautifully made film. It suffered in the story and the acting departments, but it is an entertaining and easy to watch movie. It was not, however, the best picture of 1997. Not even close. There were probably 20 movies that were released in 1997 that were better than Titanic, but the Oscar's wouldn't have gained as much public support had they not given the Oscar to Titanic.

222,"Titanic (1997) **** (out of 4) James Cameron's Oscar-winning love story about star crossed lovers (Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet) who come from different back grounds but fall in love aboard the Titanic. I remember seeing this on its opening weekend and it's amazing to see how well the film holds up after all these years. Yes, since it became so popular there are always going to be those who hold that against the film and while it's far from a masterpiece I do think it holds up quite nicely against many of the classic epics that have been made since D.W. Griffith's THE BIRTH OF A NATION. That film, GONE WITH THE WIND, BEN HUR and other epics were all grand on scale, told big stories with big effects and each of them had flaws here and there.The most amazing thing about TITANIC is the way Cameron is able to tell the fake story and mix it in with so many real-life people and events. Since 1997 I've watched countless documentaries on the real subject and watching the film on its re-release made me appreciate it so much more. The little details given about certain real-life people was a major plus and so were the smaller touches. The amount of love and detail that Cameron puts into every single shot of the movie makes it very poetic and at any time you can't help but just look around and try to take in everything in the frame. Very few films have gone all-in with their subject matters but this here goes for everything and just comes up short at a few times. It certainly helps that you have two strong leads turning in fine performance.Winslet was clearly the best of the bunch as she brings so much life to her character and perfectly manages to fit every side of her. Be it the rich, spoiled girl, the confused one, the heroic side or the love story aspect. I was less than thrilled with DiCaprio when I first saw the movie but looking back on the movie he too really stands out and delivers. Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Bill Paxton and Gloria Stuart also deliver.I think the biggest flaws in the film can be had in the screenplay. Many people objected to having the fake characters so close to the real ones during the finale but this here didn't bother me too much as when we see the real people it's in situations based on what we're led to believe happened. What bothered me in 1997 and today is that Cameron decided to make Zane the main villain over the iceberg. I really think the story starts of go overboard during the third act as Leo gets chained up and then we have more drama wrapped around the real event. There's no question that the romance made this movie such a hit but I think it could have worked with everyone had the stuff with Zane been toned down. God knows there was enough drama with the sinking to make up for Zane running around with a gun. With that said, that's about the only problem with TITANIC and those things aren't disastrous enough to ruin the movie. There's no question that the romance works, the special effects are terrific and on the whole this is just a movie that works on every level.",titan jame cameron oscarwin love stori star cross lover leonardo dicaprio kate winslet come differ back ground fall love aboard titan rememb see open weekend amaz see well film hold year ye sinc becam popular alway go hold film far masterpiec think hold quit nice mani classic epic made sinc dw griffith birth nation film gone wind ben hur epic grand scale told big stori big effect flaw thereth amaz thing titan way cameron abl tell fake stori mix mani reallif peopl event sinc ive watch countless documentari real subject watch film rereleas made appreci much littl detail given certain reallif peopl major plu smaller touch amount love detail cameron put everi singl shot movi make poetic time cant help look around tri take everyth frame film gone allin subject matter goe everyth come short time certainli help two strong lead turn fine performancewinslet clearli best bunch bring much life charact perfectli manag fit everi side rich spoil girl confus one heroic side love stori aspect le thrill dicaprio first saw movi look back movi realli stand deliv billi zane kathi bate franc fisher bill paxton gloria stuart also deliveri think biggest flaw film screenplay mani peopl object fake charact close real one final didnt bother much see real peopl situat base led believ happen bother today cameron decid make zane main villain iceberg realli think stori start go overboard third act leo get chain drama wrap around real event there question romanc made movi hit think could work everyon stuff zane tone god know enough drama sink make zane run around gun said that problem titan thing arent disastr enough ruin movi there question romanc work special effect terrif whole movi work everi level,positive
223,"I hesitate to write anything at all, since there are already more than 400 entries on this site. So let me just pop off the first few things that come to mind... 1)Hardly ""Best Picture"" caliber. As has already been noted, the dialog is ridiculous; the leads have no romantic chemistry; and - most shocking of all - the fx really aren't worthy of the hype. The sinking is impressively staged, but scenes of the Titanic underway don't seem much more credible than a lot of back-projected stuff coming out of Hollywood six decades ago. The computer-generated pans of the ship and the ocean are staggeringly obvious. 2)Billy Zane must give one of the most unbearable performances in film history. Granted, Cameron's script gives him nothing to work with; the viewer who noted he seems to be playing Satan has it just right. The scenes where he shoots (!) repeatedly at Jack on the Grand Staircase (wouldn't the list on the ship make it pretty damn hard to navigate the staircase by this point?) and uses a child to ensure his place on a lifeboat are just idiotic. I found myself grimacing every time I looked at Zane's sallow face and slanted eyes; this brand of villainy went out in pictures - I don't know - about the time of the real Titanic sank. 3)The leads are pretty hapless; and the fact they are able to spend so much time submerged in freezing water while unlocking doors, wielding axes, etc. beggars credibility. 4)A lot of the supporting roles are well-played. David Warner doesn't fall into the trap of over-acting like Zane does, and comes off quite well as the villainous valet. He seems to be having fun, which is pretty much all an actor can do in a flick like this. Gloria Stuart is extremely effective as Old Rose; she more-or-less singlehandedly endows the film with all its human pathos. I also enjoyed Bill Paxton's performance. He etched pretty effectively the character of a jaded adventurer. If only he had some decent dialog to work with. Victor Garber - a very fine actor - is wasted as Thomas Andrews. He is invariably excellent in all his scenes. 5)Folks who take umbrage to the fictional characters would do well to remember a similar framework was used with Clifton Webb and Barbra Stanwyck as an estranged fictional couple in Negulesco's 1953 Titanic. 6)WHERE WAS THE CALIFORNIAN? If you're looking for a movie villain, this ship fits the bill. The decision to cut scenes set on the derelict vessel is really regrettable. 7)On the whole, a decent, passable picture, with many striking images and a great last hour. But it pales in comparison with the 1958 ""A Night to Remember,"" which better captured the human drama of the ship's final moments. On the other hand, far better than the Stanwyck-Webb opus.",hesit write anyth sinc alreadi entri site let pop first thing come mind hardli best pictur calib alreadi note dialog ridicul lead romant chemistri shock fx realli arent worthi hype sink impress stage scene titan underway dont seem much credibl lot backproject stuff come hollywood six decad ago computergener pan ship ocean staggeringli obviou billi zane must give one unbear perform film histori grant cameron script give noth work viewer note seem play satan right scene shoot repeatedli jack grand staircas wouldnt list ship make pretti damn hard navig staircas point use child ensur place lifeboat idiot found grimac everi time look zane sallow face slant eye brand villaini went pictur dont know time real titan sank lead pretti hapless fact abl spend much time submerg freez water unlock door wield axe etc beggar credibl lot support role wellplay david warner doesnt fall trap overact like zane come quit well villain valet seem fun pretti much actor flick like gloria stuart extrem effect old rose moreorless singlehandedli endow film human patho also enjoy bill paxton perform etch pretti effect charact jade adventur decent dialog work victor garber fine actor wast thoma andrew invari excel scene folk take umbrag fiction charact would well rememb similar framework use clifton webb barbra stanwyck estrang fiction coupl negulesco titan californian your look movi villain ship fit bill decis cut scene set derelict vessel realli regrett whole decent passabl pictur mani strike imag great last hour pale comparison night rememb better captur human drama ship final moment hand far better stanwyckwebb opu,positive
224,My review is 10 star for this titanic movie best direction of James Cameron movie,review star titan movi best direct jame cameron movi,positive
225,"Watch the movie and you'll understand the title of this review. Titanic-I watch it several times a year, I own the soundtrack, Kate Winslet, Leonardo DiCaprio, Billy Zane, Victor Garber and Bernard Hill are among my favorite actors, and yet for me, the film is mixed.Everything in Titanic is uneven. Some performances are great, where as others leave much to be desired, there are some great lines in the film and others that are awful, etc. The primary problem is a lack of realism.First off with the story. How likely would it be that Jack would fall in love with Rose and risk his life for her if he knew her for only 3 days? I find the romantic scenes mixed, and while they have a few good moments, my favorite parts of the movie are when the ship sinks and with scenes with the crew and Billy Zane. Also the class envy lines get to a point of annoyance. The quarters in steerage on Titanic were some of the best. Rich and poor alike sacrificed their lives to save others as the ship went down. I really couldn't understand why James Cameron hated the rich saying he earned more money off of this film than any of the people on Titanic ever earned. Then the feminist lines grate on me too. Constantly throughout the film feminist messages are shown such as how women have tougher choices than men, how all the rich men are arrogant fools etc. I just have to wonder how many of the women on Titanic would still want to be treated the same way as men when the order 'women and children first was given'.Now that we're done with the movie's 'buisness and politics', let's take a look at the acting.DiCaprio-He's now one of my favorite actors, but I didn't care for him in this. He acting like an American tough guy did't exactly work, he'd been better off as a European artist. Part of it was the lines he was given (Such as 'I'm the king of the world'). He does get better as the film goes on.Winslet-Amazing in the film, perfectly cast and helps carry the movie.Billy Zane-If he weren't in it, I might not watch the movie. His portrayal of Cal, Rose's fiancée is outstanding. Maybe because his character is so unrealistically pompous and snobby (Even to the point where he pushes someone out of a life boat saying 'Get out, you'll swamp us!'. His lines are hilarious in the film, everything he says is great, I quote them all the time. My favorites are 'I put my faith in you good sir', 'Not even God could sink it', 'Twice the size of Moratania, and far more luxurious' and countless others. He really helps the movie.Supporting cast-Bill Paxton is solid, Victor Garber is underused but brilliant as the designer of the ship, Mr. Andrews. I love his line 'She's made of iron sir, and I assure you, she will sink'. Bernard Hill gives a good performance as the ship's Captain, all the crew members are great as well. I didn't care for Rose's mother, who I thought was too unrealistic in her hatred. Cal's henchman was also unrealistic, I mean that he would kill someone just for his boss' love? I don't know. The Digital effects are outstanding and a joy to watch. The music is amazing and my favorite score of all time. The cinematography, sets, costumes and sound is amazing.

227,"`Titanic' has a large number of fans that will cheerfully proclaim that it is the best movie ever made, and a large number of detractors who will cheerfully proclaim that is nothing but puerile, overrated garbage.  The truth lies somewhere in between - `Titanic' definitely shouldn't have won the Best Picture Oscar in 1997 (), but to dismiss the film as utter crap is very unfair.  `Titanic' tells a complex tale, and, for the most part, tells it very well.  The fact that parts of this tale are either predictable or flawed shouldn't be ignored, but it also isn't enough to turn `Titanic' into a rotten movie. `Titanic' has a slightly predictable story, but most films involving a well-known historical event tend to be predictable.  Before the movie even starts, anybody watching `Titanic' should be able to predict a few things: The Titanic will set sail in glorious fashion, with its owners grandly proclaiming its unsinkable nature; there will be a story about the passengers, some fictional, some real; the Titanic will sink in a slow and horrible fashion; and while the ship sinks, the characters will be forced to deal with their own mortality, and some will be heroes while others will be craven cowards.  See?  Predictable.  It doesn't take a genius to realize that the historical nature of `Titanic' dictates this story structure. After all, it's the structure James Cameron actually uses.  But the execution of that structure . . . well, that takes some talent, if the film has any aspirations of being good.  It means blending action, romance, drama, and historical accuracy.  And James Cameron blends them all splendidly.The main story concerns a young girl named Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet), traveling to America in order marry an arrogant millionaire named Cal Hockley (Billy Zane).  The marriage, which has been arranged by her formerly rich and now-destitute mother (Frances Fisher), is abhorrent to Rose, so in a desperate attempt to escape her fate, she attempts to jump off the ship.  Of course, she doesn't jump, but is instead saved by the happy-go-lucky Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio), and of course the two begin a brief, if implausible, romance.  This romance, which is perhaps the weakest part of `Titanic' is still vitally important to the story . . . because it gives the audience a very strong reason to care about these characters when the ship hits the iceberg, and about the choices they make. Could it have been better?  Absolutely.  But considering that the romance is a means to an end, rather than the end itself, it's not bad.DiCaprio is superb as the wide-eyed vagabond Jack Dawson - he brings enough earnest enthusiasm to the role to make it totally believable as to why Rose would fall in love so quickly with him.  Winslet's slightly less believable, though; she's good, but not great.  She puts in a nice, quiet, restrained performance, but it's so restrained at times that it borders on comatose. It's actually the minor characters that add some zip to `Titanic' - Billy Zane is outstanding as the villain Hockley, as he gives Hockley enough human nuances to make him seem like a flawed, arrogant person, and not just some standard bad guy ripped straight out of a Flash Gordon serial.  Also worthy of note is the modern-day interaction between deep-sea explorer Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) and the elderly Rose (Gloria Stuart), floating on an exploration ship far above the watery grave of the Titanic.  No only does their interaction serve as a brilliant, unobtrusive way of relaying the historical facts about the Titanic's final hours to the audience, but Paxton also manages to become a surrogate for the audience - as the movie unfolds and gets more and more interesting, it's a neat touch to see his character Lovett become more and more fascinated with Rose's stories.It would be remiss not to mention the special effects of `Titanic', which by and large is the film's strength. While the ship (and its sinking) is a product of CGI effects and model works, it's done it such a realistic manner that it never calls attention to itself, or reminds the audience that they're watching a movie. Of more importance is that the film's effects, while spectacular, never ARE the film - they always SUPPORT the film's story.There are many things to nit-pick about `Titanic' (although I find it hard to believe that people really nit-pick the minor historical inaccuracies of the film; Cameron got all the major details right, and the films probably more than 95% accurate, for crying out loud).  But those problems are nit-picks - very tiny but slightly irritating details, nothing more.  They keep the film from being an all-time great, but they certainly don't make it a bad film.  The blend of romance, action, history, and special effects probably explains the film's vast appeal - there's certainly something for everyone in this film - and it also makes `Titanic' an excellent, if not perfect, movie.

228,"Quite possibly one of the worst movies ever made, this film ignores the heart-rending stories of the 2000+ real people who were one the Titanic to present to us a redundant romeo/juliet storyline. Kate Winslet plays a spoiled ""free-spirit"" who is being forced by her mother to marry the wealthy Billy Zane. On board the Titanic, she meets Jack (Leonardo di Caprio), who teaches her to be ""free"", or in other words, be trashy and self-centered. The movie is filled with bad acting and even worse writing.

What really made this movie matter was one thing: it launched the A-list acting careers of Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. DiCaprio saw the role's potential when offered it and has had an impressive career since due to his stellar performance here. Winslet campaigned heavily for the role she got it and the same thing happened to her where her stellar performance brought about an impressive career. Give this one a try and see if you like it.

232,"Titanic (1997) is my #1 favorite film of all time and I'm so glad James Cameron re-released this masterpiece worldwide for its 25th anniversary, introducing it to the new younger generations.Went to see it with my girlfriend for Valentine's Day weekend, in 4K 3D, and it was absolutely phenomenal. Experiencing it on the big screen gave the film an epic, larger-than-life feel. Watching Titanic with an audience also amplified the emotions and people cried so much. Including us. It was a very surreal night.Titanic is a masterpiece on so many levels. The soundtrack alone is still one of the most haunting, beautiful tracks ever created (Rest In Peace James Horner). You can tell Cameron put his entire heart and soul into the creation of this film, as well as the main characters Jack and Rose. Speaking of Jack and Rose, I want others to know why they're such an important element to the story. Their characters are truly vital and necessary in order for the audience to feel the tragedy of Titanic's sinking on a deep, meaningful level. If I may explain:We know Jack and Rose were fictional. But very important to leave a lasting impression. While we wish they could've lived ""happily ever after"", Jack's death was necessary for a very crucial reason. As time goes on, Titanic's disaster becomes a long distance in history, detached from the actual trauma of the event. We can look back at the reports of the sinking, and all the deaths, and realize how horrible it must have been: but it's still just numbers to us. By the time the film came out, Titanic had been at the bottom of the ocean for 80+ years already. Very few survivors were left alive, and for most people, several generations separated them from the wreck.I think having Jack, the charming co-lead of the movie die, after we spent so much time getting attached to not only his character, but also his growing relationship with Rose, was meant to be the emotional *punch* necessary to make the disaster feel real to us in the modern world. Seeing their adventures aboard the ship, going on this journey with them, you really began to root for the couple. If it were any other movie, they likely would have gotten their happy ending. But Cameron wanted us to feel the loss - even a little bit - that the survivors and families of those lost aboard the ship felt, by taking this character away from us, just inches from the finish line. In that way, Jack is meant to be a stand-in for everyone who lost their lives that night.Those are my sincere thoughts. Kate Winslet and Leoardo DiCaprio both gave brilliant, phenomenal, and dedicated performances with their characters. No one else could've done a more perfect job. Their onscreen romance works so well because of the wonderful chemistry they share. Kate was the perfect embodiment of an Edwardian society girl; she was only 21-years-old at the time but had the mentality of a mature woman twice her age. Leo and his character felt much wiser and ambitious beyond his years, as well.The ending is possibly the most beautiful, unforgettable endings to a movie ever. It just numbs you with chills and unlocks so many emotions. No matter how many times I watch Titanic, I become immersed into the film and emotionally invested in the tragic history. This movie, winner of 11 Academy Awards, is a piece of history itself.Titanic is a timeless classic that never fails to pull at our heartstrings and remind us of a real life tragedy; a horrific disaster that took the lives of 1,500+ people in a single night. Cameron did a brilliant job at conveying the heart of this tragedy through masterful filmmaking and storytelling.

233,"TITANIC ( rating * * out of 5 )I fear I'm about to make myself highly unpopular with what follows, but I can only call 'em as I see 'em. Besides, being highly unpopular is such familiar territory for me and it just wouldn't be the same without the constant slings and pointed arrows.From writer/director James (I'm king of the world) Cameron, comes this 200 million dollar purported epic that in my view only ever reaches the status of cubic zirconia.But never fear, Hollywood will incestuously look after its own because any movie that costs the amount that could pull a third world South American country out of insolvency and destitution, is guaranteed to win eleven Academy Awards - Oscars for categories like, The Most Times Actors Say, ""No! This Way."" - The Most Soggy Extras and The Best Motion Picture Where The Male Lead Is Snubbed For A Nomination.This unfortunate male lead is none other than Leonardo Di Caprio who possesses all the rugged good-looks of a fourteen year old pimple-cream model. But it's not all bad news for Leo because he has perfected the art of being a pipsqueak while painting chubby actresses in the nude - poor old Kate Winslet's dress was so tight around the torso that the hunky Leo had to use solvent to get it off.Rose DeWitt (Kate Winslet), is engaged to the jerk millionaire, Cal Hockley (Billy Zane). Cal gives her a priceless necklace that has some significance later on as a wrinkly Rose tells the story which is seen in flashback.Anyway, Rose meets Jack (Leonardo Di Caprio), as she attempts suicide and the couple are instantly attracted (in Rose's case, as much as someone who is attempting suicide can be). The pair eventually fall in love, the ship hits an iceberg, the ship sinks, the ship becomes famous and we are subjected to this hideously expensive, self-important and time-consuming movie (I had to pause halfway through to bake some muffins as not to suffer the effects of malnutrition).However, I did give this movie two stars and that was for the special effects. To be fair, they were pretty good. As a mass of brave stunt-personnel tumbled into the icy water, I did get the sense of what the chaos and hysteria must have been like on that fateful night in 1912 - reminiscent of lunch-time crowds around the all-you-can-eat desert bar at Sizzler.In a nutshell, this film is a love story between Jack and Rose that never rises above soap-opera melodramatics. After an hour and a half of this kissy kissy nonsense, I found myself participating in open prayer thanking the Almighty for his very timely iceberg.What possibly could warrant so much money and effort? Certainly not a piece of Hollywood trivia that tells us nothing about the Titanic that we didn't already know.If I've missed the point, then to all of you 'Titanic' devotees I sincerely apologize.

237,"Are you looking for a movie that will take you on an emotional rollercoaster? Look no further than the 1997 blockbuster hit, Titanic. This epic romance-drama is a must-see for anyone who loves a good story.From the moment the film begins, you are transported back in time to the early 1900s. The attention to detail in the set design and costumes is impeccable, making you feel as though you are truly on board the Titanic. The film's director, James Cameron, spared no expense in creating a world that is both beautiful and tragic.The story follows the journey of Jack Dawson, a poor artist, and Rose DeWitt Bukater, a wealthy socialite. Despite their different backgrounds, the two fall deeply in love during the voyage. Their romance is both heartwarming and heartbreaking, as they face numerous obstacles throughout the film.One of the most impressive aspects of Titanic is the incredible performances by the cast. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet have undeniable chemistry on screen, making their love story all the more believable. The supporting cast, including Billy Zane and Kathy Bates, also deliver standout performances.But Titanic is not just a love story. It is also a tale of tragedy and survival. The film's climax, when the Titanic hits an iceberg and begins to sink, is both thrilling and devastating. The special effects used to create the sinking ship are still impressive over 20 years later.Overall, Titanic is a cinematic masterpiece that has stood the test of time. It is a film that will make you laugh, cry, and feel every emotion in between. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and watch it as soon as possible.

238,"Titanic is a marvellous, expansive film with the first rate special effects you expect from James Cameron, lending the feeling of vastness and realism you would feel. Lead acting performances are uniformly well done, though the dialogue they have to work with is disappointing. The film is hampered by an unimaginative screenplay, with trite dialogue and poor situations. But the film starts of well enough. The first one half or two hours are enthralling and even breezy, doing well to hide the films poor writing, and are a joy to watch. After this however, the tender love story which has played out is replaced with frantic, frenzy action for the next hour or so. This is the section after the ship strikes the iceberg, as the film attempts to, like a typical Hollywood film, milk every single situation and obstacle they can. This, rather than being suspenseful, just felt boring, languid, and contrived. Thankfully, the film reverts to tenderness in the last 20 minutes, with jack and rose on a piece of wood and the famous ending. The problematic bits of the film are hence those where Jack and rose are engaged in action rather than romance. Hence, I think the movie is overlong, and should've been trimmed down at the parts mentioned. Regardless, Titanic of course, is still a titanic film, with a doomed love story, and beautiful special effects, one definitely well worth a watch.",titan marvel expans film first rate special effect expect jame cameron lend feel vast realism would feel lead act perform uniformli well done though dialogu work disappoint film hamper unimagin screenplay trite dialogu poor situat film start well enough first one half two hour enthral even breezi well hide film poor write joy watch howev tender love stori play replac frantic frenzi action next hour section ship strike iceberg film attempt like typic hollywood film milk everi singl situat obstacl rather suspens felt bore languid contriv thank film revert tender last minut jack rose piec wood famou end problemat bit film henc jack rose engag action rather romanc henc think movi overlong shouldv trim part mention regardless titan cours still titan film doom love stori beauti special effect one definit well worth watch,positive
239,"When I saw ""Titanic,"" I thought it was vaguely entertaining, and the costumes and special effects were beautiful. However, I didn't leave the theatre discussing it with my friends, and I didn't feel or think any differently than three and a half hours earlier. Then I heard it had been nominated for numerous Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and I was outraged.Not surprisingly, this big-budget piece of recycled Hollywood trash won, even against three of its wonderful competitors, ""L.A. Confidential,"" ""As Good as it Gets,"" and ""Good Will Hunting."" The first has plenty of interesting plot twists and amazing performances, the second gives a fresh and cynically humorous look at romance, and the third helped ME realize some things about myself, at least.  ""Titanic"" did nothing like that.The screenplay was something that had been done dozens and dozens of times before, and as far back as the Elizabethan era, as the ludicrous, 'Romeo & Juliet'-esque romance will prove. The performances, even by such normally-wonderful actors as Kathy Bates, Billy Zane, and Kate Winslet were either dry, or over-done. I imagine that if one had to 'listen' to this movie  rather than have the dialogue and music (which is pretty at parts, but just a repeat of many of Horner's other scores) accompany the pretty images, it would be completely unbearable.",saw titan thought vagu entertain costum special effect beauti howev didnt leav theatr discus friend didnt feel think differ three half hour earlier heard nomin numer academi award includ best pictur outragednot surprisingli bigbudget piec recycl hollywood trash even three wonder competitor la confidenti good get good hunt first plenti interest plot twist amaz perform second give fresh cynic humor look romanc third help realiz thing least titan noth like thatth screenplay someth done dozen dozen time far back elizabethan era ludicr romeo julietesqu romanc prove perform even normallywond actor kathi bate billi zane kate winslet either dri overdon imagin one listen movi rather dialogu music pretti part repeat mani horner score accompani pretti imag would complet unbear,positive

241,"Titanic is a film that deeply affects the viewer. The direction and photography are breathtaking, with wide panoramic shots to give an overview of the ship, and close-up shots to focus on the characters and emotional moments. The color palette used is rich and vibrant, with a predominance of warm, golden tones to accentuate the romantic mood of the film. The fluid movements of the camera give the impression that the viewer is actually walking aboard the ship. The scenes where the ship sinks are particularly memorable, with tight and chaotic shots that give the impression that the viewer is drowning alongside the characters.The emotions conveyed by the film are also very strong. The love story between Jack and Rose is very moving, and the performances of the actors allow the viewer to become attached to these characters from the beginning of the film. The scenes of panic, chaos, and death aboard the ship are heartbreaking and allow the viewer to feel the terror that the passengers must have experienced during this tragedy. The universal themes addressed, such as social class, discrimination, family, and death, touch each of us in one way or another. These themes are addressed with great sensitivity and emotional depth, allowing the viewer to identify with the characters and feel their pain and joy.The music of the film, especially the song ""My Heart Will Go On"" by Celine Dion, is also very emotional and contributes to reinforcing the emotional impact of the film. The song is immediately recognizable and is often associated with the love story of Jack and Rose, which further reinforces the emotional impact of their story.Finally, the conclusion of the film is very emotional and tragic, with the death of Jack in the icy waters of the Atlantic. This ending is one of the most heartbreaking moments of the film, with Rose surviving but having to say goodbye to the love of her life. However, this conclusion is necessary to reinforce the emotional depth of the film and to make it an unforgettable masterpiece.In summary, Titanic is a film that manages to touch the heart of the viewer through its stunning direction and photography, universal themes, emotional music, and poignant conclusion. It is a film that continues to evoke strong emotions in viewers even after all these years, which is a testament to its exceptional quality.",titan film deepli affect viewer direct photographi breathtak wide panoram shot give overview ship closeup shot focu charact emot moment color palett use rich vibrant predomin warm golden tone accentu romant mood film fluid movement camera give impress viewer actual walk aboard ship scene ship sink particularli memor tight chaotic shot give impress viewer drown alongsid charactersth emot convey film also strong love stori jack rose move perform actor allow viewer becom attach charact begin film scene panic chao death aboard ship heartbreak allow viewer feel terror passeng must experienc tragedi univers theme address social class discrimin famili death touch u one way anoth theme address great sensit emot depth allow viewer identifi charact feel pain joyth music film especi song heart go celin dion also emot contribut reinforc emot impact film song immedi recogniz often associ love stori jack rose reinforc emot impact storyfin conclus film emot tragic death jack ici water atlant end one heartbreak moment film rose surviv say goodby love life howev conclus necessari reinforc emot depth film make unforgett masterpiecein summari titan film manag touch heart viewer stun direct photographi univers theme emot music poignant conclus film continu evok strong emot viewer even year testament except qualiti,positive

When it comes to the first half, were introduced to a romance/love story, which is just the heart of the movie. The film then needles through the past and present with breathtaking transitions. Then the second half of the film is basically a disaster movie, which some of the most heartbreaking moments introduced to film. Everything is so believable and so atmospheric. James Cameron is so talented as a director and as a writer when it comes to this film, his talent was very much noticed. This film is just....so masterful and so well made.

243,"In the opening sequence of Titanic, a group of treasure hunters send a robotic probe far beneath the ocean's surface in search of treasures (and one particularly precious jewel) still tucked aboard the titular sunken ship. The camera attached to the probe reveals a vessel that's certainly rotted but still carries hints of its prior glory. The explorers coo and sigh as they see what's been waiting a century for them, as if they're looking at their dreams made manifest. This is the day they've fantasized about, and the treasures of people who once lived and loved aboard the RMS Titanic are their bounty. When the film was released, it was a gamble the size of ... well, the metaphors present themselves a bit too easily. It was a wild risk, both for filmmaker James Cameron (who was known for Aliens and his Terminator movies) and for the studios that funded it, Paramount and 20th Century Fox. Cameron's terrible temper and a runaway production with troubles to spare - one disgruntled crew member laced the chowder at craft services with PCP one night, provoking hallucinations in 50 people, including cast member Bill Paxton - had prompted people to wonder if the legendarily expensive film was doomed for the same fate as its subject. The production budget reportedly ran over $200 million, an enormous sum by any contemporary standards that was much more so in 1997. Titanic remained No. 1 at the North American box office for 15 weeks in a row. It was nominated for 14 Oscars and won 11 of them, including Best Picture. The movie continued playing in theaters for nearly an entire year, and didn't close until October 1, 1998, after earning $600 million in North America and twice that worldwide. It was the highest-grossing film of all time until 2010, when Cameron's Avatar wrested away the title. Titanic is two movies stitched together: a swoony teenage fantasy for the ages, and a massive disaster movie that rivals any disaster movie to come out of Hollywood either before or since. The lengthy runtime makes perfect sense by this rubric, and you can see the seam where the movie pivots from one to the other, almost exactly at the halfway mark. That Titanic is two movies in one is part of its genius: If it were just the romance, it might have been written off as a ""movie for girls,"" but then there's this whole other disaster element too. From a marketing perspective, that's gold.",open sequenc titan group treasur hunter send robot probe far beneath ocean surfac search treasur one particularli preciou jewel still tuck aboard titular sunken ship camera attach probe reveal vessel that certainli rot still carri hint prior glori explor coo sigh see what wait centuri theyr look dream made manifest day theyv fantas treasur peopl live love aboard rm titan bounti film releas gambl size well metaphor present bit easili wild risk filmmak jame cameron known alien termin movi studio fund paramount th centuri fox cameron terribl temper runaway product troubl spare one disgruntl crew member lace chowder craft servic pcp one night provok hallucin peopl includ cast member bill paxton prompt peopl wonder legendarili expens film doom fate subject product budget reportedli ran million enorm sum contemporari standard much titan remain north american box offic week row nomin oscar includ best pictur movi continu play theater nearli entir year didnt close octob earn million north america twice worldwid highestgross film time cameron avatar wrest away titl titan two movi stitch togeth swooni teenag fantasi age massiv disast movi rival disast movi come hollywood either sinc lengthi runtim make perfect sen rubric see seam movi pivot one almost exactli halfway mark titan two movi one part geniu romanc might written movi girl there whole disast element market perspect that gold,positive
244,"Why did James Cameron go to so much trouble making a film that presented the physical and visual dimensions of Titanic and take the human dimensions on a fantasy-romp of titanic-sized contrivances? There are enough historical documents and memoirs about REAL people on that ship who had REAL lives and some were actually very compelling.  So why did Cameron opt to give these REAL people bit parts and invent two shallow characters? 
Good acting and high production values go a long way to cover up a poor script, and Titanic is proof of that with the Oscar frenzy that surrounded it (However, it was the first film in a long time that did not earn a screenplay nomination and won best picture).  Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet both did excellent jobs acting as did Gloria Stuart and Kathy Bates. They all deserved an Oscar in light of what they had to work with on the page.  How conventional, shallow and contrived does this sound?  Rose is in what is for all intents and purposes an arranged marriage, but she is really a free spirit ready to fly away from her upper-class roots.  If it wasn't for her darn mother.  Now to make this issue even more clear, her fiance is controlling and abusive.  The decision is clear.  She has to fall for Jack, a fellow free spirit who shows her real love.  Alas, Jack must be symbolically sacrificed so she can avoid being drowned in her life and truly find freedom in the new land.  Not only are the mechanics of the script clear, but the story is old and tired.  Titanic works because it plays on stereotypical conventions and latent emotions; it does not earn its emotional climax on its own merit.  This subject has the opportunity to be so much more genuine and powerful if only someone had taken the time to look beyond fictional romance and into true life tragedy.",jame cameron go much troubl make film present physic visual dimens titan take human dimens fantasyromp titanics contriv enough histor document memoir real peopl ship real live actual compel cameron opt give real peopl bit part invent two shallow charact good act high product valu go long way cover poor script titan proof oscar frenzi surround howev first film long time earn screenplay nomin best pictur leonardo dicaprio kate winslet excel job act gloria stuart kathi bate deserv oscar light work page convent shallow contriv sound rose intent purpos arrang marriag realli free spirit readi fli away upperclass root wasnt darn mother make issu even clear fianc control abus decis clear fall jack fellow free spirit show real love ala jack must symbol sacrif avoid drown life truli find freedom new land mechan script clear stori old tire titan work play stereotyp convent latent emot earn emot climax merit subject opportun much genuin power someon taken time look beyond fiction romanc true life tragedi,positive

246,"It's been several decades since I had the chance to watch James Cameron's masterful epic, and watching it again after all this time, I can honestly say that my feelings haven't changed: this is an exhilarating film from top to bottom, from the magnificent visuals and a love story that deserves its place among Hollywood's best.For starters, the entire cast is a knockout, with appearances by actors such as Bill Paxton, Kathy Bates, Maggie Smith, and Billy Zane, to name a few, but it's Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio's magnetic performances where Titanic truly shines.Despite being victim to countless parodies over the years, the spark between Rose and Jack remains every bit as powerful. There's also a surprising amount of humor - I especially loved the moments we see Rose abandon her ""polite girl"" status in order to help Jack, or when people begin breaking down gates or doors in order to navigate their way out of the ship.Director James Cameron truly hit a grand slam visually, and seeing that ship captured in such a beautiful and expansive light was every bit as exciting as I remember seeing in the theater. Now that I've aged a bit since then, watching the sinking of the ship made me realize why this is such a long movie - it takes time for the entire event to unfold, making the infamous tragedy all the more nerve-wracking. The entire final act is one of the most beautifully staged and thrilling sequences the movies have given us, with tension becoming higher and higher as the water slowly makes its way through the ship, and the panic and chaos among the passengers rising to terrifying heights.All in all, TITANIC certainly earned its place among cinema's finest moments. It's an exciting and emotional ride that hasn't lost its glow, and I'm beyond happy to have been able to watch this again, despite my own reservations.",sever decad sinc chanc watch jame cameron master epic watch time honestli say feel havent chang exhilar film top bottom magnific visual love stori deserv place among hollywood bestfor starter entir cast knockout appear actor bill paxton kathi bate maggi smith billi zane name kate winslet leonardo dicaprio magnet perform titan truli shinesdespit victim countless parodi year spark rose jack remain everi bit power there also surpris amount humor especi love moment see rose abandon polit girl statu order help jack peopl begin break gate door order navig way shipdirector jame cameron truli hit grand slam visual see ship captur beauti expans light everi bit excit rememb see theater ive age bit sinc watch sink ship made realiz long movi take time entir event unfold make infam tragedi nervewrack entir final act one beauti stage thrill sequenc movi given u tension becom higher higher water slowli make way ship panic chao among passeng rise terrifi heightsal titan certainli earn place among cinema finest moment excit emot ride hasnt lost glow im beyond happi abl watch despit reserv,positive
247,"I find Titanic an alright movie about a historical event. It is 3 hours long, so it feels detailed. If anything, I feel it's a little too long. It'll be slightly better if it's a half hour shorter. With the nudity, it feels like it should be rated R, but it's simply rated PG-13. There's hardly no f-bombs, so if it had several of those, it might have been rated R. I'm not the biggest fan of romances, so the romance Cameron created I'm not the most fond with. If I wrote the script, I would just leave it out.I find this movie did a good job at showing the events that led up to the sinking of the Titanic. It does feel detailed and gives a very good look, though the romance developed was not real.

249,"An epic movie, which you will remember for the rest of your life after you'll watch it. Simply the kind of movie, which you can't describe in words, you have to watch it, at least once! , to see what we, the people who appreciate this movie, are talking about. After watching it for 3 times already in my life, i still can't believe i've seen a gigantic ship sinking in a film, with such an incredible realism. I heard there were used some test puppets to make it look like people were falling off the ship, well i haven't noticed any, everything looked so real, all the people that were falling and screaming for help. The fictional story about the 2 main characters, falling in love, is genially directed, some of the scenes are very touching, very well filmed. And the casting was great, i don't want to hear any stupid replies that DiCaprio is a bad actor, hell no ! Him and Kate Winslet both did a great job, there's no doubt about their acting skills whatsoever. Those who are calling this a bad movie, i hope you people never watch a movie ever again, cause i assume all you know is teenage comedies and horror movies. Also, please stop calling us ""pathetic titanic fan boys"", this is not twilight where 15 year old girls claim it to be the best movie because Robert Pattinson is part of the cast.

250,"I am one of the few people, I think, that has not seen all of Titanic. I saw most of it, and couldn't sit through the rest.You see, I have a great interest in the *real* Titanic. And I truly believe that this three-hour 'epic' is the greatest insult to the tragedy ever to be put on film. It has nothing to do with the ship, or what really happened. The story would have been more realistic set in some city! As it is the ship is just pushed into the background of a love story that could never, and I repeat never, have happened in true life. Rose would never even have met Jack, and most likely she would not have wanted to! Steerage passengers on the Titanic, and all other ocean liners of the time, were strictly prohibited from association with the other classes, and first class held themselves so aloof that they did not even look on second class, let alone steerage, as human beings let alone material for lovers. Rose would have been raised with these attitudes; they would have been engraved in her no matter how 'free-spirited' she was! And what are the chances that a noblewoman, who has likely never done a lick of work in her life, could ever swing an axe without chopping off someone's hand? Nil.This movie is nothing but Hollywood capitalising on a tragedy that cost hundreds of lives. The only really fitting tribute to the doomed liner is Titanic the musical, which has done it's research and is a triumphant tribute to the ship and the world she sailed in, in which the characters become secondary and the doomed liner takes on a life of it's own.",one peopl think seen titan saw couldnt sit restyou see great interest real titan truli believ threehour epic greatest insult tragedi ever put film noth ship realli happen stori would realist set citi ship push background love stori could never repeat never happen true life rose would never even met jack like would want steerag passeng titan ocean liner time strictli prohibit associ class first class held aloof even look second class let alon steerag human be let alon materi lover rose would rais attitud would engrav matter freespirit chanc noblewoman like never done lick work life could ever swing axe without chop someon hand nilthi movi noth hollywood capitalis tragedi cost hundr live realli fit tribut doom liner titan music done research triumphant tribut ship world sail charact becom secondari doom liner take life,positive

255,"James Cameron creates a head spinning tale of romance and despair with the characters of Jack and Rose and the tragedy of the Titanic sinking. This movie is still captivating people everywhere over 15 years after its original release. If one is searching for a solely historical account of the Titanic sinking, then this is not the movie for them. While tying in key historical elements, Cameron has stated that Titanic was not meant to be a historical account but a love story. He does a wonderful job of combining the tragedy of the sinking and the story of forbidden lovers, but some historical events are not included. For example, many reviewers ask why Cameron did not include the Californinan shutting of its radio for the night. This scene was in fact filmed but then cut due to Cameron feeling that ""If Titanic is powerful as a metaphor, as a microcosm for the end of the world in a sense, then that world must be self contained."" However, if you are looking for a beautiful, heart wrenching love story with a historical setting, this is the movie for you. You can't help but to be swept up in the elegance of the period. The costumes and sets are lavish for the upper class and realistically drab for those of the lower class. The dialogue is excellent, seamlessly creating a beautiful story line. The special effects used along with gorgeous camera work produce shots upon shots of heart stopping images. Winslet and DiCaprio have undeniable chemistry and are extremely convincing in their roles of wealthy and poor, respectively.Overall, this film is a must see classic for people of all ages.

Kate Winslet whines her way to an average performance. I'm not sure why she was picked to be the lead female. DiCaprio does a good job but not his best work. Billy Zane is also weird casting choice and he isn't exactly great. The best actor/actress performance in the movie is probably Gloria Stewart. The CGI is not good, I know it was early in the game but some of it looks bad for 90's standards. I do like the movie being a wide stream outlet for knowledge on the titanic.

263,"Many people may be familiar with the romantic love story between Jack and Rose from the well-known film Titanic. James Cameron is both the producer and the director of the film. The real-life incident of the RMS Titanic colliding with an iceberg on April 14, 1912, when the ship was sunk, served as the basis for this tale. That led to numerous deaths, which added to the tragic love tale of a man and a lady that many people still remember today. It also added to the sadness at the time.The part in this movie that most impressed me was when Jack was talking to the billionaires seated at the dinner table while telling them about his own life, despite the fact that Jack is only a commoner. And never enjoyed a fine meal, but Jack was skilled at doing it. The talk flowed well, and the wealthy individuals enjoyed Jack's humor. Make every minute of your life count is one of Jack's movie statements that struck a chord to me and served as a judgment in real life.Despite the fact that the movie's premise is a drama that invites many people to get bored because of the love story of two individuals, the story is kept interesting for more than three hours, allowing spectators to enjoy the story without becoming bored. This is common in many dramas, but the scenes here look fantastic and the two performers' skills give the film an impeccable appearance. The movie took home a number of honors, including the Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Direction, Best Visual Effect, and Best Production and Design, among others.Along with the outstanding stories previously mentioned, the soundtrack, which includes the award-winning song ""My heart will go on,"" is something else that should not be missed. Numerous awards, as well as films, because this song is strong and matches the tone of the film perfectly.And I think the artist who performed ""My Heart Will Go On"" had a wonderful and strong voice. Make this song a financial contributor to the success of this film. Help improve the appearance of this film's overall aesthetic Another legend among the world's most beautiful tunes has been started by this song. Millions of individuals favor it Everyone in the world, in my opinion, has heard this song because it has become a global hit.In conclusion, I'd like to state that the Titanic movie is regarded as a film that produced another legend since it was enjoyable and suitable for everyone, however this may not be true given the circumstances. If you don't enjoy a movie from the start, sitting through a longer-than-3-hour film could feel like torture. And this movie's plot is regarded as having a good movie.

268,"Titanic is the backdrop of this timeless film about love. The film describes a story about a young noble English woman Rose, who meets a common American man Jack. She is swept away by him as he romantically courts and romances her. He leads her and he shares his life with her. He takes her places and he affectionately cares for her. He declares his feelings for her and they share romantic moments together. Love is at the core of this film. It is a universal truth that touches our hearts and transcends boundaries. This film reveals love is what we are all looking for. Love is what we are here to experience in our lives as we live day-by-day.After all is said and done on your time on Earth, as you look back, what will you remember and cherish the most? What will be those memories?This film reminds us of what matters most in our lives. It is not material goods and comfort. But love. It is love that binds us to one another. Love is the source from which we come from.Life is a gift. It is up to each one of us to make the most of each day in our lives. The film conveys the message, live as though there is no tomorrow. For what is life without having lived it and experienced it to the fullest? In the end, what matters most is love. The love that sustains us, that gives us life. That makes us feel alive, cherished and safe.As I watched this film, my heart was deeply moved. Tears welled down my eyes. I felt what the characters were experiencing.

270,"For the very first time last night, I watched one of the most universally acclaimed movies of the 1990's, probably of all time, in its entirety with my mom. And that movie is James Cameron's Titanic, a gripping, epic historical drama based on the ill-fated maiden voyage of the RMS Titanic, the magnum opus of the White Star Line, and for her time, the biggest moving object ever built by mankind. Being the most luxurious ocean-liner of the 1910's, she was known as the ""ship of dreams"" to everyone, and ultimately carried over 1,500 people to their deaths in the freezing waters of the North Atlantic very early in the morning of April 15, 1912.Of course, to give the story something of a focus, James Cameron chose to center the movie around two Titanic passengers from very different social classes, who fall in love on the ship's voyage: 17-year-old aristocrat Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet) and dirt-poor young artist Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio). And, personally, I think the romantic plotline here really works, and fits in with everything else. It also bears the addition of a villain: Rose's arrogant 30-year-old fiancé, Pittsburgh steel fortune heir Caledon ""Cal"" Hockley (Billy Zane). And he is quite an excellent villain. And if you've read my review for Balto, I know I'm making myself seem like a hypocrite. But here, the idea of a romance/love triangle storyline actually works perfectly in a story about how a ship sunk and people died. Plus, romance aside, James Cameron was very meticulous about staying true to the real sinking, even portraying key events, like the rescue efforts and the band playing. The only other major deviation he made, was the only thing I have to question: portraying the ship's crew as incompetent at best and outright negligent at worst, except for Captain Smith (Bernard Hill), who is actually portrayed as far more benevolent than he truly was. By contrast, First Officer Murdoch (Ewan Stewart), in particular, goes from a heroic officer who died while trying to single-handedly launch a lifeboat (a task requiring 12 men) to taking bribes, shooting two men trying to rush the lifeboats and shooting himself out of remorse, so I'm not surprised his descendants threatened a lawsuit against Cameron. Even WSL CEO J. Bruce Ismay (Jonathan Hyde), who's pretty much the REAL villain of this movie, is depicted as paying no heed to safety, by encouraging a speed record that the WSL already knew the Titanic COULDN'T BREAK! Speeding up against ice warnings was something that the real Captain Smith CHOSE to do, not something the real Ismay suggested. To the movie's credit, the movie does accurately depict Ismay helping people into the lifeboats and only climbing into one himself when nobody is left to call over. And his bad rep came from that alone, so I don't know whether he really deserves it.But anyway, the acting in this movie is fantastic. Kate Winslet, in addition to covering her posh English accent up with a posh American accent, is immensely graceful as Rose. Leonardo DiCaprio is clever and charming as Jack. Billy Zane makes an effective villain as Cal. As for all the Titanic crew members, though their personalities are mostly misrepresented (as mentioned before), they're mostly played by actors who almost accurately resemble their real-life counterparts, and they all do a great job with the material. In regards to the framing device, Gloria Stuart (may she rest in peace) is lovely as elderly Rose. Bill Paxton (may he also rest in peace) is affable as treasure hunter Brock Lovett. And though he isn't really an actor, Lewis Abernathy provides good comic relief as Lewis Bodine, Brock's best friend.The writing is great, too! The movie has an EXCELLENT mixture of excitement, drama, and humor. The sequence of the ship hitting the iceberg and sinking (which occupies at least the halfway point to the 2-hour and 55-minute mark), is exactly as taut and tragic as it needs to be. Some of the more exciting moments include the introductory scene of the ship, and of course, Jack's famous line: ""I'M THE KING OF THE WORLD!!!!!!"" And of course, in a movie about such a tragic event, there has to be levity, hence why the movie brings in some great humor exactly when necessary. A favorite scene of mine is very early on in the movie, during a forensic analysis of the sinking, Bodine drops this fabulous line: ""She's got her whole ass sticking up in the air, and that's a BIG ass!"" HA!Visually, Titanic doesn't disappoint. It's gorgeously filmed, special mention going to the wide shots of the ship out on the sea. In fact, James Cameron actually built a life-size replica of the Titanic for filming, using ORIGINAL BLUEPRINTS!! That's how much he cared about getting it right. The special effects also may be somewhat dated by today's standards, but James Cameron had every right to be proud of the ""Propeller Guy"" bit.And last, but certainly not least, the music! Before, I've expressed my love for the work of James Horner, may he rest in peace, but this movie has, without a doubt, the best score he ever wrote! It's so angelic, so beautiful, so poignant, and sounds exactly right for the mood of every scene, ranging from sounding grand and sweeping during the ship boarding to sounding flawlessly dramatic, suspenseful and ominous during the iceberg collision and the sinking. And of course, in the end credits, his romantic theme for Jack and Rose becomes Celine Dion's world-famous and gorgeous power ballad, ""My Heart Will Go On"", which never fails to give me chills. I'm not kidding when I say that this movie's soundtrack is a must-have!All things considered, Titanic is a masterpiece of epic proportions. The overly long runtime and misrepresentation of the ship's crew definitely forced me to take off a few points, but overall, it has everything you could ever want from a movie: drama, excitement, humor and plenty of other things.

272,"When I went to see this film, I was expecting something truly great.  I was sadly very disappointed.  The characters were generally poorly developed, leaving me with a sickly sweet after taste, rather than a feeling of sorrow or compassion. Whilst the talent gathered (Winslet, Zane) hinted at true acting ability (they have provided far better performances in other films), the script is lacking in anything other than schoolgirl Mills and Boon. The technical effects have obviously been done to high standards, as the boat looks impressive, but that is where it ends, as the man-child DiCaprio slaughters the basest of emotional lines, as makes the romance seem cliched and below par. If you absolutely must see this film, see it on the silver screen, as the lack of grandeur which is displayed on the small screen leaves only the ""acting"" to behold.",went see film expect someth truli great sadli disappoint charact gener poorli develop leav sickli sweet tast rather feel sorrow compass whilst talent gather winslet zane hint true act abil provid far better perform film script lack anyth schoolgirl mill boon technic effect obvious done high standard boat look impress end manchild dicaprio slaughter basest emot line make romanc seem clich par absolut must see film see silver screen lack grandeur display small screen leav act behold,positive

Visuals are outstanding even at this time, after 16 years - Titanic is aging wonderfully. The actor, all of them, did a very strong job, and i loved the two leads. I can not understand why is there so much negative buzz about this film. They say it's to chezee. You can throw a rock in me if you haven't saw more chezee stuff years after (Twilight and all the dancing shxx ""movies"" comes in to a mind first). Well i guess lots of people will always hate what is popular and at the same time really good - and that's a rare combination. Movies like this aren't made every day to say the least, and it's shame that so many people trashes them. Well, you can always just ignore them. Titanic is outstanding motion picture in every possible way, and it got what it deserved - 11 Oscars, 1,6 milliard at the box office and hardly nforgettable journey - it's hardly gets better than this.",greet lithuaniaim titan buff read lot materi watch countless documentari tragedi im movi buff well get everi time watch unforgett piec work storytel best visual outstand even time year titan age wonder actor strong job love two lead understand much neg buzz film say cheze throw rock havent saw cheze stuff year twilight danc shxx movi come mind first well guess lot peopl alway hate popular time realli good that rare combin movi like arent made everi day say least shame mani peopl trash well alway ignor titan outstand motion pictur everi possibl way got deserv oscar milliard box offic hardli nforgett journey hardli get better,positive

293,"I must admit, as a movie buff, that this was the worst piece of sap-o-rama ever the ""grace"" the screen. I mean, What was the point?  It was about two little spoiled kids running around on some stupid boat saying stuff like ""I'll never let go"". Come on!!  The romantic side of it was so contrived it felt like I was being choked as I watched it.  None of the characters were even half-way decent, and all the actors were just a waste (Leo Dicaprio is a loser) the boat was the main character, and the iceberg was the supporting actor/bad guy.  Towards the end of the movie, I was hoping the boat would just sink already just to put me out of my misery.  When Kate Winslet was threatening to throw herself overboard, I was on the edge of my seat yelling ""Jump! Do it, Jump!""  James Cameron uses the death of a thousand innocent people in an attempt to illicit some emotion out of the audience, since the characters of the movie can't do it.  The only redeeming quality of the whole film was Kathy Bates, but even she couldn't save this boat from sinking.  Let's face it, the only reason there is to watch this movie is if you got a couple of hours to kill and your dentist can't give you a root canal just right now, but you want to prepare yourself for the pain.",must admit movi buff worst piec saporama ever grace screen mean point two littl spoil kid run around stupid boat say stuff like ill never let go come romant side contriv felt like choke watch none charact even halfway decent actor wast leo dicaprio loser boat main charact iceberg support actorbad guy toward end movi hope boat would sink alreadi put miseri kate winslet threaten throw overboard edg seat yell jump jump jame cameron use death thousand innoc peopl attempt illicit emot audienc sinc charact movi cant redeem qualiti whole film kathi bate even couldnt save boat sink let face reason watch movi got coupl hour kill dentist cant give root canal right want prepar pain,negative

302,"There is a lot of obvious hype associated with this film. Let's just face it, though, the main reasons why anyone would watch it would be for Leo and Cate, who are not necessarily the best actors in this film. I'm not saying they're not good actors, I'm saying they stunk in this film. The special effects were decent (and I will say the film makers did a good job making the ship eye-pleasing), but IT even has several major flaws. For instance, right before the ship goes under, you can see an unfinished blue-screen image behind your main characters.Don't get me wrong, I LOVE the story of the REAL Titanic, but I find this movie an insult to that story. Editing was atrocious--there's no reason for any film to be over 2 1/2 hours (with the exception of MAYBE a biographical movie), and the writing and screenplay was horribly stilted.I will say that the music was perhaps better than I could have predicted (and not just the ""My Heart Will Go On"" song either). There is one scene that stands out to me when the ship is sinking and pounding bass music is heard. That could very well be the highlight of the film. As for the mood throughout, it was extremely dull. I was more relieved than sad when Jack died, which I know cannot be what the director intended.In a nut shell, I find it horrible that they turned the beautiful story of the Titanic into an over-hyped chick flick.",lot obviou hype associ film let face though main reason anyon would watch would leo cate necessarili best actor film im say theyr good actor im say stunk film special effect decent say film maker good job make ship eyepleas even sever major flaw instanc right ship goe see unfinish bluescreen imag behind main charactersdont get wrong love stori real titan find movi insult stori edit atrociousther reason film hour except mayb biograph movi write screenplay horribl stiltedi say music perhap better could predict heart go song either one scene stand ship sink pound bass music heard could well highlight film mood throughout extrem dull reliev sad jack die know director intendedin nut shell find horribl turn beauti stori titan overhyp chick flick,positive
303,"The special effects are great in this film, and the love story is compelling. Even though there is no uncertainty as to how this movie plays out, it is still quite dramatic and interesting. Plus, you have to marvel at a movie that managed to win the Academy Award for best picture and was also a huge box office hit - a distinction shared with few films over the last twenty years.However, there are a few oversimplifications of the social situation of the passengers in the context of the realities of the early 20th century that bug me every time I watch this movie. First off, there is a heavy handed message of rich = bored and unhappy, poor = genuine and full of life. Given that there was absolutely no social safety net anywhere in the world in 1912, there could be nothing more brutal and grinding than being poor in that era, as if there is any such thing as ""easy poverty"" at any point in history, including today.Second, and somewhat accompanying the first sticking point, is the idea that Rose will somehow be free to be something out of a 1969 Virginia Slim's commercial if only she can lose that rich stiff she is engaged to (Billy Zane's character, Cal) and run off with kindred free-spirit Jack. This illusion not only confronts the fact of grinding poverty in early 20th century America, this flies in the face of entrenched sexism enshrined in the law during that time that wasn't even confronted as a problem until the 1960's. Who, in 1912, is going to let Rose put on a pair of jeans and ride side-saddle on Coney Island? Let her learn to pilot a plane? Allow her to pursue her career goals unless they involve teaching school, nursing, or performing (i.e. doing something that involves serving men)? And even learning those skills cost money she did not have. The fact is at that time a woman in America or anywhere else in the world was considered property. She could either be the property of a rich man (evil Cal) or a poor man. The only main character in this movie that seems to be facing facts is Rose's mother who shows genuine terror at the idea of being poor again - and she SHOULD be afraid, VERY afraid.I once had a 3rd sticking point, but it has been nullified over the last ten years. That sticking point was that Billy Zane's character could feel so superior and entitled given that his wealth and stature were accidents of birth, not the fruits of his own enterprise and imagination. I have since come to realize that some of the smuggest most entitled people on earth are those that were born into their circumstances, so I withdraw that objection.This movie did do a service by dispelling the myth that the slogan on the Titanic was ""women and children first"", when it was, in fact, ""first class women and children first"". In reality, if you were a first-class woman, you had a 97% chance of survival, and just about every first class woman that did die chose to stay behind because she did not want to leave her husband. If you were a female steerage passenger you had about a 45% chance of survival. Worse yet, third class children had a 1 in 3 chance of survival, which was the same rate of survival as the first class men. Not one of either the first or second class children died on the Titanic.Thus, I still enjoy the movie immensely, but I think that the false presentation of early 20th century social reality will always bother me a little every time I watch the film.",special effect great film love stori compel even though uncertainti movi play still quit dramat interest plu marvel movi manag win academi award best pictur also huge box offic hit distinct share film last twenti yearshowev oversimplif social situat passeng context realiti earli th centuri bug everi time watch movi first heavi hand messag rich bore unhappi poor genuin full life given absolut social safeti net anywher world could noth brutal grind poor era thing easi poverti point histori includ todaysecond somewhat accompani first stick point idea rose somehow free someth virginia slim commerci lose rich stiff engag billi zane charact cal run kindr freespirit jack illus confront fact grind poverti earli th centuri america fli face entrench sexism enshrin law time wasnt even confront problem go let rose put pair jean ride sidesaddl coney island let learn pilot plane allow pursu career goal unless involv teach school nurs perform ie someth involv serv men even learn skill cost money fact time woman america anywher el world consid properti could either properti rich man evil cal poor man main charact movi seem face fact rose mother show genuin terror idea poor afraid afraidi rd stick point nullifi last ten year stick point billi zane charact could feel superior entitl given wealth statur accid birth fruit enterpris imagin sinc come realiz smuggest entitl peopl earth born circumst withdraw objectionthi movi servic dispel myth slogan titan woman child first fact first class woman child first realiti firstclass woman chanc surviv everi first class woman die chose stay behind want leav husband femal steerag passeng chanc surviv wors yet third class child chanc surviv rate surviv first class men one either first second class child die titanicthu still enjoy movi immens think fals present earli th centuri social realiti alway bother littl everi time watch film,positive

306,"A big boat hits a huge lump of ice and slowly sinks. Meanwhile, a chirpy American lad, Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio), gets it on with Rose (Kate Winslet), a posh bit of British totty, much to the annoyance of the girl's fiancé, Cal (Billy Zane, putting in a wonderfully loathsome performance).James Cameron's Titanic is what I call 'factasy'. In other words, it's a factual story combined with fantastical elements to make the finished article more entertaining to the masses. A more recent example of this melding of truth and fiction is The Aeronauts, but where that film played it too fast and loose with the facts and ultimately came crashing down to earth in tatters, Cameron gets the balance of real and imagined just right, making his film both a fascinating insight into one of the most famous disasters of the 20th century, and a thoroughly charming love story.A master storyteller, Cameron successfully steers his way around any potentially disastrous obstacles that threaten to bring the film to a standstill. Even though there's a good hour and a half before any sight of an iceberg, Titanic is thoroughly engrossing from start to finish, a testament to its director's skill at weaving a good yarn, and to the talent of his impressive cast (which includes Kathy Bates as Molly Brown and David Warner as Spicer Lovejoy). Kate and Leo make for one of cinema's most iconic pair of lovers, and exude a likability and charm that carries the first half of the film. The latter part is mostly about the special effects, something that Cameron excels at, always pushing the boundaries of technology. Even after 23 years, the sinking of the mighty ship is a sight to behold, and still sends chills up the spine.It's only the film's closing moments that prevent me from giving the film full marks: why oh why did Old Rose (Gloria Stuart) chuck her priceless necklace into the sea? Give it to your granddaughter, donate it to an orphanage, put it in a museum, let Bill Paxton have it, but please don't throw it overboard! And as if that crazy act wasn't reprehensible enough, when the old dear carks it, her spirit returns to the Titanic to be reunited with Jack -- excuse me Rose, but what about your dead husband and father to your child?9/10.",big boat hit huge lump ice slowli sink meanwhil chirpi american lad jack leonardo dicaprio get rose kate winslet posh bit british totti much annoy girl fianc cal billi zane put wonder loathsom performancejam cameron titan call factasi word factual stori combin fantast element make finish articl entertain mass recent exampl meld truth fiction aeronaut film play fast loo fact ultim came crash earth tatter cameron get balanc real imagin right make film fascin insight one famou disast th centuri thoroughli charm love storya master storytel cameron success steer way around potenti disastr obstacl threaten bring film standstil even though there good hour half sight iceberg titan thoroughli engross start finish testament director skill weav good yarn talent impress cast includ kathi bate molli brown david warner spicer lovejoy kate leo make one cinema icon pair lover exud likabl charm carri first half film latter part mostli special effect someth cameron excel alway push boundari technolog even year sink mighti ship sight behold still send chill spineit film close moment prevent give film full mark oh old rose gloria stuart chuck priceless necklac sea give granddaught donat orphanag put museum let bill paxton plea dont throw overboard crazi act wasnt reprehens enough old dear cark spirit return titan reunit jack excus rose dead husband father child,positive

308,"Director James Cameron's Titanic (1997) immerses viewers in the real-life tragedy of the RMS Titanic, a British ship that collided with an iceberg and met its devastating fate in the icy waters of the North Atlantic Ocean in 1912. This cinematic masterpiece successfully captures the profound sadness and gripping details surrounding this historical event, leaving audiences deeply moved. One cannot help but be overwhelmed by the sheer tragedy depicted throughout the film. Titanic delves into the depths of human emotion, highlighting the heart-wrenching loss of more than a thousand lives. The magnitude of the disaster is portrayed with utmost respect, ensuring that the viewers understand the enormity of the event without exploiting it. The movie's somber atmosphere is established through meticulous attention to detail. The haunting scenes of bodies floating in the frigid waters serve as a chilling reminder of the immense human toll and the stark reality faced by the passengers on that fateful night. These moments evoke a sense of terror and anguish, leaving a lasting impact on the audience's psyche.Leonardo DiCaprio's portrayal of Jack, the charismatic and free-spirited artist, adds depth and vitality to the film. His performance breathes life into the narrative, allowing viewers to connect with the characters on a profound level. DiCaprio's talent shines brightly, and his chemistry with Kate Winslet, who plays Rose, is palpable, enhancing the film's emotional resonance. The final moments of Titanic are a haunting depiction of the passengers' impending doom. Many onboard, unaware of the true danger, cling to the misguided belief in the ""unsinkable ship."" These scenes poignantly illustrate the devastating realization that their lives are about to be cut short, creating a powerful and profoundly sorrowful experience.Titanic (1997) remains a timeless classic due to its ability to captivate audiences with its tragic narrative and superb performances.

309,"""Titanic"" has all the elements of a smashing movie.  Unusually high level of detail (comparable to ""Star Wars""), a respectful tribute to Titanic's researchers, and plenty of money.  The cast is skilled, the soundtrack beautiful, and the cinematography masterful.  Now all we need is a plot. After all, because history betrays the ending, the ship's fate alone will not draw audiences.  Something needs to turn the beautiful documentary into a gripping movie.  A love story does the job nicely; it was a good idea. But then, Cameron takes over.Good Lord, what a nauseating soap opera.  The farm-boy hero, spunky maiden and evil villain trio, all but used up in ""Star Wars"", is disgustingly uncreative.  Some of the lines (""And he saved me, in every way a woman could be saved"") are so cheesy even the masterful thespians DiCaprio, Winslet and Stuart can't save their characters from being reduced to cardboard cutouts. What was Cameron thinking??  Anyone sharp enough to appreciate the detail would vomit from the recycled storyline, and anyone naïve (or stupid) enough to fall for the fairy-tale romance wouldn't acknowledge the historical faithfulness.In any case, everybody ought to see this movie at least once; it's not bad for a brainless love story and beautifully crafted.

310,"I have watched Titanic a number of times. The first being in the cinema in 1997, and the most recent last night (2020).It just never fails to move me in many ways. The disgust you feel at the egotistim and treatment of lower classes as well as the deeply engaging stories of those who were destined to be a part of history (in more ways than they ever bargained for), and the final abject terror watching the boat's demise makes this film a true rollercoaster of emotion.While the love story between Jack and Rose is fictional, and does take some 'Hollywood' artistic license, it adds a depth a richness to the story to allow you to empathise with many of the passengers on board. Watching it now, as a mother of young children, the Irish mother telling a fairytale to her two children as the ship is going down is infinitely heartbreaking in a way I didn't fully relate to the first time (I was 14). I think that is what makes this a timeless classic.The absolutely stunning cinematography of the ship's pride and beauty, intertwined with a great storyline full of interesting characters and a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack culminating in the ship's final dramatic and horrific hours still stands up 23 years later and always leaves me emotional and breathless. If you didn't know Titanic's true story, you'd be forgiven for thinking this was a far-fetched, over-egged Hollywood action film!

Many ""Titanic"" films were made during the 20th century, but the famous James Cameron film from 1997 is the most well known.This film version of the legendary ship was a phenomenal and unusual success, so much that it was something like 7 months on theaters and proved to be the most cost-effective movie ever made. Many people even went to the theaters twice to see it. And the number of Academy Oscars that it won is another prove of its success. Plus, most everyone praised and liked the film back then. It was a hit on VHS and DVD as well.Strangely, in recent years the movie has been getting many lukewarm reviews and I read somewhere in the Internet that it was considered the worst Oscar winner ever. How ironic, huh? It seems that it has become fashionable to hate this movie.It's an okay movie, but not all that great. However, my biggest problem with the movie was always its length. 3 hours is too much and becomes tiring, even exhausting.The story is well known for being based in a real disaster story which happened in 1912. That makes this a realistic movie. The ship's replica is very well made and detailed. In that way they achieved perfection, making it look just like the real ship, which was the biggest, fastest, most luxurious and most beautiful of its time. Sadly it hit an iceberg and sank on its maiden voyage and more than half of the people passed away. You know what bothers me most? First, the number of lifeboats wasn't enough because, stupidly, they believed that more lifeboats would be a waste of space in an ""unsinkable"" ship. Unsinkable? Yeah, right... Second, the ship was going too fast when its engines hadn't been tested enough... and all of this just because of headlines!""Titanic"" has beautiful instrumental music, a beautiful ballad named ""My Heart Will Go On"" sung by Celine Dion, beautiful angles of view of that pretty ship, romance, tension, suspense and incredibly tragic moments. To see people falling in despair and committing suicide is a reality and it certainly happened in real life. This movie also contains some nudity and sex and even some shocking and controversial scenes of homicide. However, it's not just a melodrama. It has also romance and even some moments of comedy.Besides, to see the Titanic sinking, breaking in two and to see its rear at an impressing height is breathtaking. It will live forever in your mind because it's very impressive. Spectacular, yes, but tragic.The actors do a good job in their roles: Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Victor Garber, Danny Nucci, Jason Barry, Bernard Fox and others...By the way, Mr. Andrews, Jack Dawson, Fabrizio and Tommy Ryan are the best and nicest characters of this movie.Another equally revolutionary ship was the french ocean liner SS Normandie in the 30's. Its appearance was very similar to the RMS Titanic and inside it followed the same concept of luxury in a classic and old fashioned style, very different from the luxury standards of modern liners. The SS Normandie didn't sink, but its ending was tragic too. During the World War II, it was was converted to a troopship in 1942, caught fire, capsized and sank at the New York Passenger Ship Terminal. Although it was salvaged at great expense, restoration of the vessel was deemed too expensive, so it was scrapped in 1946.

317,"A great epic romance and disaster film indeed, Titanic the movie. Titanic is a 1997 American film directed, written, co-produced, and co-edited by James Cameron. Incorporating both historical and fictionalized aspects, the film is based on accounts of the sinking of the RMS Titanic, and stars Leonardo DiCaprio (Jack Dawson)and Kate Winslet (Rose Dewitt Bukater) as members of different social classes who fell in love aboard the ship during its ill-fated maiden voyage.This movie is not just showing how two persons fall in love but it also shows social issues like the inequality that has been the focused from the very beginning and at the end of the movie. First from how money generated that ship like those who paid lower stays at the bottom part of the ship and those who paid more stays at the top part of the ship. Why does it matter? Because they have thought that the place at the top is more comfortable and safe like if ever the ship will sink, they will not be the first ones to sink. At the last part, it shows how the rich ones were saved by the countable boats they have used and the poor ones not treated well then died in the sea.This movie is truly a good one because it is not only about love but also about some facts and true-to-life happenings like how people are treated based on their social status. That is considered as Marxism. But like other movies, this one also has bad sides like the noticeable mistakes in the cinematography and it has scenes that are not appropriate for kids.Overall, the movie was good for people who wants to watch a movie that is double purpose and for those who love watching dramas which makesal them cry. But as far as I have observed, this movie is really well known and can be known by most of the people living when 1997 came and until present.

318,"Titanic is a film brought by crafted film-maker James Cameron and stars gifted actor Leonardo DiCaprio and talented actress Kate Winslet. It's a true masterpiece that stays true to the real tragedy in 1912 even if it involves some fictional elements. While a jack and Rose relationship didn't happen on the real titanic(and would have certainly not happen due to strict class segregation), their relationship is still beautiful and extremely emotional. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are both phenomenal in their performances as Jack and Rose respectively and there couldn't have been any other actor and actress who could have played those characters better than Leo and Kate did. Even Gloria Stuart portrays Old Rose very well.Billy Zane also plays a great villain as Cal Hockley. As the son of a steel tycoon millionaire, he goes from a gentlemen to a madman when he discovers rose's love for jack and a desperate person who wants to save his own skin and not caring for others the moment he realises the situation is getting serious.The visual effects are stunning. James Cameron has managed to bring the Iconic Ocean liner the titanic back to life in screen and make it look so real. The effects are futuristic even by 1997 standards. The song My heart will go on by Celine Dion really fits the movie very well. The direction by James is also beautifully crafted and the cinematography is also well done.The emotional depth is felt as well through jack succumbing to the effects of hypertomia but saving rose in the process to the deaths of over 1500 people in the ship. The rest of the cast do perform their roles well.While there are a few historical inaccuracies in the film, the movie is still beautifully made.",titan film brought craft filmmak jame cameron star gift actor leonardo dicaprio talent actress kate winslet true masterpiec stay true real tragedi even involv fiction element jack rose relationship didnt happen real titanicand would certainli happen due strict class segreg relationship still beauti extrem emot leonardo dicaprio kate winslet phenomen perform jack rose respect couldnt actor actress could play charact better leo kate even gloria stuart portray old rose wellbilli zane also play great villain cal hockley son steel tycoon millionair goe gentleman madman discov rose love jack desper person want save skin care other moment realis situat get seriousth visual effect stun jame cameron manag bring icon ocean liner titan back life screen make look real effect futurist even standard song heart go celin dion realli fit movi well direct jame also beauti craft cinematographi also well doneth emot depth felt well jack succumb effect hypertomia save rose process death peopl ship rest cast perform role wellwhil histor inaccuraci film movi still beauti made,positive
319,"One of my biggest childhood memories was seeing Titanic in the theatre. I was only 7 years old when it was first released and I had no idea what a hell of a ride I was in for. My father always had a keen interest in the Titanic and its sinking, and I remember a large Atlas like book he had of the Titanic full of pictures of the wreckage, the dive teams efforts, salvage operations, etc.It was just after Christmas 1997. We went to my grandparents for a weeks holiday. During our visit, the adults decided we were all going to go and see Titanic. So we arrive at the cinema, walk in through the front entrance and there's a line-up like you can't even imagine. a huge line-up, of people, all hoping to get in and see Titanic. we stood in line for a few minutes until an usher came and yelled out ""ALL THOSE WANTING TO SEE TITANIC, TICKETS ARE SOLD OUT FOR TODAY!"", and I think that was my first inkling of ""wow this movie really is a big deal"", So dad went to the ticket booth and got us tickets for two days later, in a 3pm session that had enough tickets left for all five of us.Fast forward two days, we go in and get our seats for the 3pm session, the cinema is jam packed, i'm talking not one seat free. three incredible hours later, we walk out of the theatre, walk back through the shopping centre and get in our 4WD to drive back to nan and pops. The second I got in the car, I was just totally mesmerized the entire way home, thinking about this movie and constantly repeating wow, wow wow, inside my head. As a seven year old kid, Seeing this, all I can say this movie had me gobsmacked.Anyway, onto the movie...A 101 year old woman Rose sees a drawing of a young nude teenager on TV that was recovered from the wreckage, she quickly realizes the nude girl in the drawing is in fact her. She gets into contact with Brock Lovett (played effortlessly by Bill Paxton), who conducts frequent dive and salvage operations of the Titanic's wreckage. He is searching for a lost treasure known as the Heart of the Ocean which is an extremely rare and insanely valuable diamond. After a very disappointing failed salvage attempt, Rose and Brock come into contact and Rose is flown out to their salvage boat, Where rose ends up telling a group (including her granddaughter, Lizzy) her entire story on the Titanic from start to finish.Her story begins with Her arriving in Southampton with her mother, fiancé, Cal (played wonderfully by Billy Zane), and Mr Lovejoy (David Warner), who kind of acts like family security. We are introduced to a young and very beautiful Kate Winslet. The Titanic is still docked and the docks are crowded with avid passengers and enthusiastic spectators, all itching to see the Titanic set off on its maiden voyage. We are introduced to the handsome and mischievous Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his friend Fabrizzio in a tense poker game. They're lucky enough to win tickets on board and merely make it on board.The next portion of the film has various characters talking about the Titanic's construction, kind of as a way to feed the audience some background knowledge I guess. We're introduced to the ship's owner, builder and a whole array of other first and third class citizens. After Rose explains how depressed she was starting to feel after being caught up in the madness of being a first class citizen, and being forced to marry someone she denies her love for, we see Rose upset and about to jump off the ship committing suicide. Here, we have a lovely and eerily quiet introduction between Rose and Jack. For assisting Rose, Her fiancé cal, invites him to dinner in first class the following evening. We see the clear distinction between Third and first class. Jack has no idea how to behave like a first class citizen, and portrays that very nicely on screen to the point where it's actually quite humorous. Later on in the film, after a few more dramas, we see what I can only describe as the most Iconic and memorable on scree kiss, of any movie in history. Now we come to the part of the film we came to see. The sinking. The remainder of the film is pure epic. We see the ship slowly sinking, more water rushing through the various floors and decks, the passengers becoming progressively more panicked, The captain trapping himself in the wheel house, people turning on each other, distressed children and parents, people jumping off the ship into the freezing ocean trying to survive and it's incredible how much you do actually feel like you're there on the ship. All of it was done in studios but it literally does look like its sinking into a real ocean. And the scene where the ship splits in two, was the icing on the cake for me. After the ship has sunk, the survivors floating in the ocean become slowly more and more quiet, until there's complete silence. I still to this day find it a very eerie and disturbing part of the film. All in all, Titanic is quite simply put, just a ground breaking piece of cinema. The film makers got the Era spot on in terms of clothing and how characters look and behave, and as I understand got the look of the Titanic's interior spot on for the time period too. It really does feel like you're back in 1912, and it's always a movie I can come back to every few years and enjoy it as if it was my first time seeing it as a 7 year old.

320,"Titanic seems like a split movie. On one hand, there is the implausible and badly scripted romance between the fictional characters, Jack and Rose. On the other hand, it is a spectacular re-telling of the story of the world's most famous shipwreck. Whether you like this movie or not depends on which half you focus on.The bad: The scripting is very bad. There are many, many lines which cause me to groan and wince. The dialogue comes off as stilted, and oftentimes an annoying stereotype of 1912 speech. The fictional characters are annoying and unlikeable. The whole film seems to have a left-wing anti-first-class bias where only the poor can actually feel love and the rich are simply snobs trying to one-up each other, never mind how many real first class couples had much deeper love for each other than Jack and Rose's fairytale relationship. There are some very disrespectful scenes in here that have little grounding in history. Officer Lightoller is portrayed as hysterical and unstable. Officer Murdoch is made to shoot two passengers before killing himself. The film's score is often repetitive and bombastic. The ""Heaven"" scene comes off as very contrived.The good: The movie is spectacular to see. Titanic buffs will love to see how good and accurate the large scale model of the ship looks. Thomas Andrews and Bruce Ismay are portrayed very well by Victor Garbor and Jonathan Hyde. The sinking scenes are quite accurate and show the violence of the event very well. One feels very sorry for the passengers because of the horrors that they suffered. The special effects look very good, even the CGI. The underwater photos of the wreck in the beginning are very beautiful and Cameron would go on to do some very important research with his submersibles after this film. In the end, this film generated a lot of interest in the story of the Titanic.Verdict: The Titanic itself is the real star of the film.

324,"Anyone who saw the old black & white movie ""A Night to Remember"" will appreciate the improved special effects in this one, but miss the more accurate portrayal of the historic event. James Cameron really managed to bring the old ship back to life for the big screen, but at the same time he strayed from history, painting a negative and inaccurate picture of the crew and passengers.I'm not referring to the fictitious love story between the two fictitious characters Kate and Jack. This addition is clearly pure invention, a device to involve the audience's emotions in the tragedy in a way that a documentary style film doesn't. That's fine. What's not fine to twist the historical facts about real people, which Cameron clearly does in this film. Many of the portrayals of the crew members are fictionalized. I suppose it's forgivable to make ordinary people into heroes, but to make heroes into villains, as this film does, is I think, unethical. It's damaging to the memory of those people, and I'm sure it's offensive to their surviving descendants.The biggest misrepresentation is of 1st Officer Murdoch, who is portrayed as losing his mind and shooting passengers and himself during the sinking during the evacuation. In reality Murdoch did not shoot passengers or himself. The writers of the film completely made this up. Captain Smith is portrayed as a weak, ineffectual human being incapable of making decisions. For me, Bernard Hill was wrongly cast in this role - he does not have the charisma and presence of Smith. According to most studies and records, Smith was also active until the very end. A one point he was calling back boats on his megaphone when he saw that they weren't full – a scene that was edited out of the movie for the final release.I've always had mixed feelings about this film. The effects, sets, costumes and technical accuracy are impressive; as are some of the characters. I particularly like the chief engineer, and Murdoch; but there are aforementioned inaccuracies, and also many unnecessarily silly bits like the scene with Cal chasing Jack and Kate down the grand staircase with a gun, firing shots as he went, which cheapen the film.I think that, when you make a film like this, dealing with such a monumental tragedy, with characters representing real people in recent history, it's very shameful to invent bad things about them.But all in all this remains an epic film and was one of the most impressive films I'd ever seen at the cinema back when I first saw it in 1997.",anyon saw old black white movi night rememb appreci improv special effect one miss accur portray histor event jame cameron realli manag bring old ship back life big screen time stray histori paint neg inaccur pictur crew passengersim refer fictiti love stori two fictiti charact kate jack addit clearli pure invent devic involv audienc emot tragedi way documentari style film doesnt that fine what fine twist histor fact real peopl cameron clearli film mani portray crew member fiction suppos forgiv make ordinari peopl hero make hero villain film think uneth damag memori peopl im sure offens surviv descendantsth biggest misrepresent st offic murdoch portray lose mind shoot passeng sink evacu realiti murdoch shoot passeng writer film complet made captain smith portray weak ineffectu human incap make decis bernard hill wrongli cast role charisma presenc smith accord studi record smith also activ end one point call back boat megaphon saw werent full scene edit movi final releas alway mix feel film effect set costum technic accuraci impress charact particularli like chief engin murdoch aforement inaccuraci also mani unnecessarili silli bit like scene cal chase jack kate grand staircas gun fire shot went cheapen filmi think make film like deal monument tragedi charact repres real peopl recent histori shame invent bad thing thembut remain epic film one impress film id ever seen cinema back first saw,positive

We already know many fools clamored around the graves of anyone known as Jack Dawson.

326,"Being set during the tragic sinking of the titular ship in 1912, Titanic follows the story of star crossed lovers amidst the historic calamity. Setting out to accurately capture the incident, director James Cameron poured years of research into depicting the event as closely as it played out on that fateful day. Successfully diving to the wreckage of the ship on multiple occasions, Cameron immersed himself with the task of documenting some of the smallest aspects and stories aboard the vessel. While many of the films characters are based on real attendants of the initial voyage, the leads Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) & Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet) portray a completely original romantic tale throughout the event. Although the star crossed lovers are no new concept, the performance of the leads, accompanied by Cameron's writing, create one of the most timeless love story ever put to film. Each character beautifully adds to the story and each actor brilliantly embodies the time period and their individual roles in the wider tale. As a spectacle of visual effects, even over 25 years after its release, The Titanic was masterfully constructed to showcase every aspect of the absolutely horrific incident. With nearly every scene being filled with wondrous attraction, the climax resonates as the toll is taken on the emotional journey endured by viewers. Additionally, the companion piece of Celine Dion's 'My Heart Will Go On' fits flawlessly into the film and both elevate each others passionate message. James Cameron created a once in a lifetime experience with Titanic and, while capturing the realism of the event, created one of the greatest romances of this era.",set tragic sink titular ship titan follow stori star cross lover amidst histor calam set accur captur incid director jame cameron pour year research depict event close play fate day success dive wreckag ship multipl occas cameron immers task document smallest aspect stori aboard vessel mani film charact base real attend initi voyag lead jack dawson leonardo dicaprio rose dewitt bukat kate winslet portray complet origin romant tale throughout event although star cross lover new concept perform lead accompani cameron write creat one timeless love stori ever put film charact beauti add stori actor brilliantli embodi time period individu role wider tale spectacl visual effect even year releas titan master construct showcas everi aspect absolut horrif incid nearli everi scene fill wondrou attract climax reson toll taken emot journey endur viewer addit companion piec celin dion heart go fit flawlessli film elev other passion messag jame cameron creat lifetim experi titan captur realism event creat one greatest romanc era,positive

I hadn't watched it for many years until the past few days when I watched it a few times in a row, and really appreciated it on a deeper level I felt, or maybe just remembered how truly great it is.Sure it has its cinematic flaws, such as seeing waves lapping at the shoreline next to the set when it should be the Titanic in the middle of the ocean.
But then again all films have their little quirks and errors scattered throughout. Despite those found in Titanic, the emotion that the film makes me feel is unmatched by any other movie. It is pure magic from start to finish, many times throughout the film my eyes well up with tears, or outright balling.It's one of the few movies that I would pay good money to see again in a massive full theatre.I really don't know why it's not in the IMDb top 250, when many films on the list are trash in comparison to Titanic, in my opinion.Titanic is in my Top 10 of all time, alongside Lord of the Rings, Hero, Kimi No Na Wa, Princess Mononoke, and Lonesome Dove, and others.",watch titan dozen hundr time sinc first got vh kid hadnt watch mani year past day watch time row realli appreci deeper level felt mayb rememb truli great issur cinemat flaw see wave lap shorelin next set titan middl ocean film littl quirk error scatter throughout despit found titan emot film make feel unmatch movi pure magic start finish mani time throughout film eye well tear outright ballingit one movi would pay good money see massiv full theatrei realli dont know imdb top mani film list trash comparison titan opiniontitan top time alongsid lord ring hero kimi na wa princess mononok lonesom dove other,positive

330,"An Open Letter to 20th Century Fox, James Cameron, Leonardo de Caprio and Kate Winslet:Dear Production Company, Sirs and Neato Breast Package:I am writing you to notify you that I have finally finished watching Titanic after repeated attempts over the past 7 years to watch it. It took approximately 23-30 separate cracks at viewing it, right where I left off to complete this task. I know that this might seem an overly long time to view all 194 minutes but I assure you the task was accomplished as fast as I possibly could. If you wouldn't mind terribly I have a few comments that may or may not be helpful to anyone reading this:* I really loved the 15 minutes of present day Rose talking to the diving crew (Bill Paxton and Suzy Amis) that appeared throughout the movie. I found everyone in those segments to be amazingly brilliant actors, and the scenes heartwarming, poignant and emotionally beautiful. * If you stopped right there it would have been a great masterpiece. * The choice to ruin such a wonderful movie short with 189 minutes of purely agonizing, torturous hell no doubt had a significant upwards impact on the suicide / murder rate of 1997. * I think I speak for everyone on this - if you killed Leonardo de Caprio in the opening credits even that would have been too much face time. * In the Director's cut DVD, even if Kate Winslet's nudey scene replaced 185 minutes of the 189 minutes of agony, it wouldn't have been enough of an apology for the remaining pain inflicted upon the audience. * In the ending credits Kevin Owers was mistakenly listed as Steward #3. He was actually Steward #4. Mark Capri was Steward #3. Only an imbecile would have made such a silly gaffe as Kevin and Mark look quite different. * Not even five minutes into watching it, I've never rooted so hard for an iceberg in all my life. * Never did I understand why there is a 7 day waiting period to purchase a firearm until the 12th attempt at watching Titanic. * The movie might have been a lot better if Leonardo pushed Kate off the railing in the ""King of the World scene"" and the whole thing played out as a murder mystery with a British cast actor playing the inspector. * Leonardo de Caprio was in the movie. WHY?! If you hate us so much why don't you just make a Death Ray Laser and blow up the world. Make the pain go away you $%#@!er! * A mime could have done a better job with a halogen light, water-filled bath tub, rubber ducky and a toaster. And more people would have liked it even though it was done by a mime. * There was a distinct lack of blood sucking zombies in the movie. Except for Leonard de Caprio. Actually he didn't really suck, that would have required talent and effort... * For $200 million dollars you really skimped on the iceberg, Cameron. It should have been much bigger. A chihuahua could have been hit by that thing and come away without a limp. * Celine Dion would have been most affective as Frozen Bobbing Corpse #35 instead of letting her sing! * You forgot to put a camera in the car! You're useless you know that? * Leonardo de Craprio was in the movie. You *bleep!*ersHopefully you found some of this feedback worth reading.Sincerely, Vincent B.

They really needed a more masculine lead for the love story to be convincing (but then that would have cut into ticket sales for the 13-19 female demographic, right?)  Anyway, one other thing that bothered me was unevenness of the dialogue.  Winselt's dialogue seems to jump from Victorian to Gen X somewhere during the halfway point; the merging of 90's attitude with a pre-WWI setting bothered me in general (language, cursing, general attitude of some of the characters, etc.), not to mention the way Cameron manipulates the audience against Billy Zane's character, who really has done nothing wrong until he whips out a gun near the end (wouldn't *you* be mad if your fiance was carousing around with some strange guy days before your wedding?  Me too).  And what was the deal with ""old Rose"" throwing the diamond off the ship?  That made absolutely no sense to me.With all that said, the overriding message of the movie (which was summarized in Jack's speech at dinner) is a good one, the storytelling is well done for the most part, and the special effects are awesome (with the exception of one or two scenes)",let get neg way dicaprio winselt akin boston terrier golden retriev realli need masculin lead love stori convinc would cut ticket sale femal demograph right anyway one thing bother uneven dialogu winselt dialogu seem jump victorian gen x somewher halfway point merg attitud prewwi set bother gener languag cur gener attitud charact etc mention way cameron manipul audienc billi zane charact realli done noth wrong whip gun near end wouldnt mad fianc carous around strang guy day wed deal old rose throw diamond ship made absolut sen mewith said overrid messag movi summar jack speech dinner good one storytel well done part special effect awesom except one two scene,positive

335,"I figured that everyone who voted would give it either a 10 or a zero, so I knew that my vote of six would be next to useless.  No, it's not worth a ten, but not so bad as to give it a zero.  Anyway, after watching it (on cable, not the big screen), I had to think about my feelings about it before commenting.  The obvious things have all been said: the bad script, etc. But what I was bothered by was the cinematography.  The use of filters and such was too prevalent.  I realize this was to diffuse the light and give everything a soft, antique-y look, but it bothered me nonetheless.I watch movies and ask myself, ""What does this scene add to the overall movie?""  In many cases with this film, the answer was ""Nothing at all.""  I understand the importance of establishing shots, but I don't see the need for them to be that long.  I got up once to go to the bathroom, and when I returned, it was still the long, sweeping, panoramic establishing shot! Ok, by this time I had figured out it was a big ship.I also didn't think the whole ""outside"" story set in the present was necessary, but I guess James Cameron wanted something to differentiate this story from all the other 'true love versus class struggle' stories.I do often get emotional at sad movies (hard for a guy to admit), but I didn't cry for this one, for whatever reason.

336,"I almost always refrain from posting negative reviews.  What I find ridiculous may be sublime to others.  However, this is one movie that I find so disgustingly revolting that I cannot resist adding my unwelcomed two-cents.If you're one of the three people on earth who hasn't seen the film, PLEASE take my advice and find something more constructive to do with your time.Director/writer James Cameron has reduced a TRULY horrific event into a ludicrously trite love story that makes Days of Our Lives seem like a Shakespearean tragedy by comparison.  Instead of focusing the story on actual people and events,  Cameron took the easy way out and created a cast of dull, sterotypical characters who spout inane dialogue seemingly lifted from a tv-movie-of-the-week.  Rampant historical inaccuracies, cliched directing, uninspired acting, and ridiculously cheap sentimentality all add up to one over-hyped, overrated spectacle.The only thing more nauseating than the film itself was James Cameron's ""moment of silence"" at the Oscars for the real victims of the disaster. The ""movie"" Titanic has about as much to do with the actual disaster as the Police Academy movies do with law enforcement.

338,"James Cameron's Titanic is unequivocally a masterpiece, and in my opinion, the finest movie Hollywood has ever produced. From every conceivable angle, this film excels, setting an unparalleled standard in cinema.Starting with the directing, James Cameron's vision and meticulous attention to detail are evident in every frame. His ability to blend historical accuracy with compelling storytelling makes Titanic a tour de force. The narrative unfolds with a perfect balance of romance and tragedy, drawing viewers into the world of the ill-fated ship and its passengers.The cinematography is nothing short of breathtaking. Each scene is crafted with such precision that it feels like a painting come to life. The sweeping shots of the ship, the ocean, and the heartbreaking moments as the disaster unfolds are visually stunning and emotionally charged.The story and storyline are both compelling and immersive. Cameron weaves a rich tapestry of characters and events, making the viewer feel every joy, heartbreak, and loss. The romance between Jack and Rose is beautifully developed, serving as the emotional core of the film.Costumes and set design are another standout aspect. The period-accurate costumes add authenticity and grandeur to the film, while the ship itself, meticulously recreated for the movie, serves as a character in its own right. The level of detail in every aspect of the set design is awe-inspiring and enhances the film's immersive quality.The CGI and special effects are revolutionary, especially considering the film was released in 1997. The sinking of the Titanic is depicted with such realism and intensity that it remains one of the most memorable and harrowing sequences in film history.The acting performances are superb, with Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet delivering career-defining roles. Their chemistry is palpable, and their portrayals of Jack and Rose bring depth and humanity to the film. Their performances add significant value, elevating the story and making their characters' journey unforgettable.The music by James Horner is fabulous, adding an emotional depth that resonates throughout the film. The hauntingly beautiful score, coupled with the iconic ""My Heart Will Go On,"" elevates the emotional impact of the story, making it even more unforgettable.Having seen over 1000 movies, Titanic is the only film I've rated 10/10 on IMDb. This speaks volumes about its impact and enduring excellence. Titanic is not just a movie; it's an experience, a timeless epic that continues to captivate and move audiences decades after its release. It deserves every Oscar win it received, a testament to its unparalleled craftsmanship and artistry.In conclusion, Titanic by James Cameron is a cinematic triumph, a film that embodies the very best of Hollywood. From its masterful direction and stunning cinematography to its compelling story, exceptional performances, and fabulous music, everything about this movie is fabulous. It stands as a testament to the power of cinema and remains, in my opinion, the greatest film ever made.",jame cameron titan unequivoc masterpiec opinion finest movi hollywood ever produc everi conceiv angl film excel set unparallel standard cinemastart direct jame cameron vision meticul attent detail evid everi frame abil blend histor accuraci compel storytel make titan tour de forc narr unfold perfect balanc romanc tragedi draw viewer world illfat ship passengersth cinematographi noth short breathtak scene craft precis feel like paint come life sweep shot ship ocean heartbreak moment disast unfold visual stun emot chargedth stori storylin compel immers cameron weav rich tapestri charact event make viewer feel everi joy heartbreak loss romanc jack rose beauti develop serv emot core filmcostum set design anoth standout aspect periodaccur costum add authent grandeur film ship meticul recreat movi serv charact right level detail everi aspect set design aweinspir enhanc film immers qualityth cgi special effect revolutionari especi consid film releas sink titan depict realism intens remain one memor harrow sequenc film historyth act perform superb leonardo dicaprio kate winslet deliv careerdefin role chemistri palpabl portray jack rose bring depth human film perform add signific valu elev stori make charact journey unforgettableth music jame horner fabul ad emot depth reson throughout film hauntingli beauti score coupl icon heart go elev emot impact stori make even unforgettablehav seen movi titan film ive rate imdb speak volum impact endur excel titan movi experi timeless epic continu captiv move audienc decad releas deserv everi oscar win receiv testament unparallel craftsmanship artistryin conclus titan jame cameron cinemat triumph film embodi best hollywood master direct stun cinematographi compel stori except perform fabul music everyth movi fabul stand testament power cinema remain opinion greatest film ever made,positive
339,"A spellbinding, moving and awe inspiring motion picture.Even to be able to successfully make such a big scale movie is a feat in iteself. Particularly, the second half, showing the ship sinking is a great filmmaking achievement.Besides, the film offers an audio-visual treat by virtue of its great settings, beautiful costumes and wonderful background score.But even with all these features, the movie would have been superficial if the story wasn't poignant enough. Thankfully, the love story is one of its strongest aspects. I think there are two reasons why the love story is so touching and iconic:1.)The idea of watching the romance between two charming young lovers on the grandest, most magnificent ship in the world is fascinating.2.)On top of that, knowing that it's not too long before the ship hits the iceberg and starts to sink,thus separating the two of them forever.The ending is particularly remarkable. There are a few scenes towards the end which add great emotional depth to the ill-fated love story:The 101-year old rose dropping the diamond in the ocean, the camera moving through pictures of young rose while the old rose is asleep and finally that magical last scene- capturing the essence and spirit of the whole movie- in which the ship becomes alive and the two lovers reunite.In a nutshell, Titanic is a great motion picture which is timelessly and universally appealing.",spellbind move awe inspir motion pictureeven abl success make big scale movi feat iteself particularli second half show ship sink great filmmak achievementbesid film offer audiovisu treat virtu great set beauti costum wonder background scorebut even featur movi would superfici stori wasnt poignant enough thank love stori one strongest aspect think two reason love stori touch iconicth idea watch romanc two charm young lover grandest magnific ship world fascinatingon top know long ship hit iceberg start sinkthu separ two foreverth end particularli remark scene toward end add great emot depth illfat love storyth year old rose drop diamond ocean camera move pictur young rose old rose asleep final magic last scene captur essenc spirit whole movi ship becom aliv two lover reunitein nutshel titan great motion pictur timelessli univers appeal,positive

342,"I have to admit that the sinking of Titanic is done extremely well.  It is terrifying to watch, and probably the closest to the real thing we will ever see.  Amazing special effects as well as realistic direction of all the extras.  You could see that every person aboard was scared.  It was very clever to show us earlier in the film how the Titanic sank, from the computerised sinking shown to old Rose, so you knew it would break in half, and how it would go down, etc.  I felt that added another sense of tension.The love story that underlined the movie was what disappointed me.  This kind of terrible scripting and love-you-till-the-end-of-time encounters is now seeping into other movies, eg: Armageddon.  Does anybody honestly think a 'proper' girl in 1912 would indulge in spitting lessons?  Or pull the finger at Hockley's 'henchman' whilst going down the elevator?  Or make love in the back of a car with someone she has only known since being aboard the Titanic?The sketching scene is the only love scene needed.  It is showing us that Rose is starting to come out of her shell and rebel, although it is a private moment.  There is an unspoken intimacy between Rose and Jack that is beautiful, and expresses their love for each other better than a hand pressing against a steam covered car window.  I'm sure that scene made many a man wish he could draw his girlfriend/fiancee/wife.On the whole, parts of the film make me twinge, that bloody song, f'rinstance.  As well as blatantly obvious computer generated shots and terrible scripting (notice it didn't get a nomination for Best Original Screenplay? - it has been years since a film that won Best Film was nominated for that award).

345,"James Cameron's Titanic is without a doubt the most accurate version of the ship, the people and the events that took place on a cold April night in 1912 on the North Atlantic. The sinking of the Titanic immortalized Jack and Rose in their love. The most beautiful love is often regret. Without long-term love, eternal love disappears. James Cameron tells us in a piece: Believe in love. But at the same time, it also suggests that without eternal love, no matter how beautiful love is, it cannot compete with life. Rose could die for love, but in the end, thanks to Jack's grace and pleading, he chooses to live for love, and the man left behind is miserable.

The audience knew the ship was going to sink, but leading up to the ship sinking made you care about the people and crew. This film was about building on the characters.

350,Titanic has got to be one of the best films of all times. James Cameron delivers on this retelling of a real-life tragedy about a ship wreck after a cruise ship hits a glacier. But this is more than a retelling of a real-life tragedy - it's a story of unlikely love between an upper class woman and a lower class fellow in the early part of the 1900s. It's a truly breath-taking tale with some deep tragedy inherent to the story described above. The cinematography and special effects were pretty outstanding for a film from the 90s. There's also a great film score that runs through the film including My Heart Will Go On by Celine Dion.,titan got one best film time jame cameron deliv retel reallif tragedi ship wreck cruis ship hit glacier retel reallif tragedi stori unlik love upper class woman lower class fellow earli part truli breathtak tale deep tragedi inher stori describ cinematographi special effect pretti outstand film there also great film score run film includ heart go celin dion,positive
351,"Directed by James Cameron, Titanic is an epic romance and disaster film that captivates viewers with its gripping story. Released in 1997, it remains one of the most iconic and influential films in history. History of cinema Titanic is a timeless love story set against the backdrop of the most tragic maritime disaster. The film tells the story of Jack Dawson, a free-spirited artist, and Rose, a wealthy young woman involved in a difficult commitment. There is passionate romance and references to social classes.The film's greatest strength is its masterful storytelling: James Cameron weaves together Jack and Rose's personal drama. It is part of the historical events related to the unfortunate voyage of the Titanic. The attention to detail in recreating the ship's rich interior and the sequence of her tragic sinking add a sense of realism. This immerses the viewer in the impending tragedy.To sum up, Titanic is a cinematic masterpiece that continues to win the hearts of audiences more than two decades after its premiere.

353,"This is a moderately entertaining film, but overlong and certainly not deserving of multiple Oscars. I've found that, on video, it's best watched in several sessions! I was an early fan of James Cameron and am depressed to see the extent that success has led him to excess. As in THE ABYSS, the director's self-importance seems to radiate from the screen.I'm surprised at how few people comment on the music. To me it is the most trite, tacky and clumsy part of the whole thing. Whenever we hear the theme that goes with the horrible song ""The heart will go on"" - which is often! - whatever mood James Cameron has managed to create is destroyed. This is particularly grating towards the end. I found this film's music score particularly disappointing bearing in mind that James Horner has written some excellent film scores.",moder entertain film overlong certainli deserv multipl oscar ive found video best watch sever session earli fan jame cameron depress see extent success led excess abyss director selfimport seem radiat screenim surpris peopl comment music trite tacki clumsi part whole thing whenev hear theme goe horribl song heart go often whatev mood jame cameron manag creat destroy particularli grate toward end found film music score particularli disappoint bear mind jame horner written excel film score,positive

When Rose meets Jack an unlikely romance blossoms as the Titanic embarks on it's ill fated maiden voyage.
Cameron truly put in a lot of hard work to create an absolute masterpiece here. Yes the movie has flaws but what movie doesn't? I love how he made what could of been a dreary and gloomy drag of a movie and turned it into quite an up beat story (up until Titanic strikes the ice berg). This is in my favourites.

Their acting is terrible... and I think they are both extremely talented - this may be because of the difficult circumstances surrounding the shoot or because of Mr Difficult himself - James Cameron. The plot is non-existent... how can you invent a story around the sinking of the Titanic?.

360,"Titanic is one of the very most well made movies I have ever seen. You can debate about it's greatness, but it surely is not bad.I saw Titanic on VHS right when it came out, I was about seven or eight. I didn't really pay attention, but I liked the sinking part. So it was right after Christmas last year, and I was flipping through channels and saw that this movie just started on HBO. Hearing a lot about this film and having nothing better to do at the time, I thought I'd watch it. Not remembering it at all, and watching about thirty minutes in, I didn't really expect the ship to sink. I never thought about it, that is pretty awesome because the people on the ship didn't expect it. This movie does a very good job of drawing you into the main characters. You know Jack and Rose are going to end up together, but at the same time it also gives you a feeling that it's not going to happen. Watching the movie, you know they want each other. It finally happens, and you really start to get into the movie. Like I said before, you don't really wait for the ship to hit the iceburg, you don't think about it. Then, it finally happens that one night. The makers of the movie did a very good job on focusing on other characters meeting their fate while still concentrating on Jack and Rose. The sinking part is amazing. It does an unbelievable job of showing you how horrific and huge it really was. It also did a great job of showing you the event wasn't over once the ship went under the surface. The very end scene, when Jack and Rose meet in heaven, is brilliant.This movie is incredibly well made, and for certain not bad as many close minded people think.Watch the movie with an open mind, and you will not be disappointed. Many people watch the movie with a closed mind expecting it to be ""gay"", and find excuses while watching it. This movie is very, very well made, flawless, and excellent.

361,"So you flip through the cable channels on your remote. The same old music videos are running, and the reruns get tiring. Later, you find something interesting. The evening news, Entertainment Tonight, 60 Minutes, VH1, and every other network airs clips from this, the biggest money-making film in history. TITANIC emerges as a genuine Hollywood classic for the second generation of American cinema. Never since GONE WITH THE WIND has there been powerful moviemaking with heavy genius from James Cameron. It's more than just a love story. It's an all-out disaster movie with style and vigor combined with a creative instrumental music score. It even began the craze that lured us into discoveries of the gigantic ship that never proved itself when it sunk anyway.Brilliant use of photography is what stands out the best. Imagine every single little piece of detail that wouldn't fit on this message. Replicas of the engine room and the interior designs are highly crafted to maximize the full experience of being on the Titanic while sailing on crisp, clear sea water filled with dolphins swimming with grace. During the night, one can look up the starry skies while the bright lights shine. How tragic it is for a luxury liner to capsize in half, sinking miles beneath the surface, and showing off the greatest achievement in motion picture special effects! A job extremely well done! Who will match this kind of excellence in the near future?As for the players, the pair of Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are now remembered as the Clark Gable & Vivian Leigh of the next generation. Both are young, of course, and they really can ACT! Winslet should have taken home the Oscar (what blasphemy of those Academy Awards judges!). Her performance as ""Rose"" is a show stealer, as she did most of the incredible acting far better than today's young actresses. From smoking a cigarette, to possessing true beauty, to posing nude, to being a heroine, and to become a survivor, this will be a role so hard to beat in Winslet's future films. DiCaprio, on the other hand, also does magnificent as a ""street boy"" and a ""troublemaker"". The second half is the most important time to discover his best talents, including the end. Both are sensational in almost every respect.Well, you can't always expect a movie to be perfect. TITANIC's shortcomings are relatively minor. The ""modernized"" scenes don't quite prove true to a historical masterpiece made with expensive sets and decorations. Mr. Jerry Garcia Lookalike should've changed his shirt, instead of wearing the one with ""Happy Face"" shot in the head. But Gloria Stuart as the old ""Ross"" makes up for the modern touch in telling and revisiting the Titanic story through her past experiences. It's also important that we already know how the disaster had become, and that the movie tells under a fictional basis.Of localized interest: Diana Morgan was once a TV news anchor for an NBC station out here. She has recently taken on an acting career playing the role of a news reporter, notably in BABYLON 5. You will hardly get to notice her on that small TV set shown at the start of the film, but you can hear her voice.Over three hours of powerful and unprecedented movie imagery.

362,"In honor of the 100 year anniversary of the sinking of the Titanic, the movie Titanic was re-released in theaters, digitally remastered and in 3-D. Having seen the movie in theaters in 1998 when it came out, and loving it ever since, I was happy to go see it again in 2012. We owned the VHS when I was growing up so I've probably seen Titanic at least a dozen times. There's nothing quite like seeing it in theaters though. It's a film of epic proportions in both budget and content, and I think seeing it on the big screen does it incredible justice. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing it there for the second time.I think many people criticize Titanic for the ""cheesy love story"". Jack and Rose are the early 1900's version of Romeo and Juliet, complete with a history that spans a mere few days, clashing backgrounds and of course Jack's death at the end of the movie. They even have some corny dialogue here and there (ex: ""I'll never let go Jack. I'll never let go.""). In spite of that however, I thoroughly enjoy their story. I feel that, unlike Romeo and Juliet, Jack and Rose's attraction to each other is genuine. She loves him because he pulls her out of her shell and shows her that there is more to life than money and social status. He loves her because she takes a chance on him despite societal expectations and loves him for who he truly is. I think it's great. Call me a romantic but I'm a sucker for their story. On a side note, it's so surreal to see Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet so young. They've certainly evolved as actors since Titanic.What James Cameron and his crew were able to do with special effects, construction and design in Titanic just floors me. Titanic is just so horrifyingly authentic. Every scream, every person crushed from a torrent of water, every piece of the ship ripped apart just looked so real to me. I think that's why I like it so much. I don't get my kicks from seeing people suffer, but there was something strangely beautiful in how that movie was shot and how the action of the ship sinking unfolds. I really felt like I was there with all those people. I really appreciated just how many different scenes there were. They made it a point to address many different parts of the ship, many different people and many different horrific ends. So sad. So beautiful. I hope that makes some sense.So now you know, I'm a sucker for Titanic.

363,"I avoided seeing this film for all of three years, due to the ludicrous amount of hype that surrounded it. I can now honestly say it was not worth the wait.  In his time, James Cameron has directed some classic films, Terminator, Aliens and The Abyss instantly spring to mind for their claustrophobia and generally tense atmosphere.  Titanic forgoes all said atmosphere and tension, relying on treacle-like sentimentality, and the unnecessary over-emphasis on special effects eclipses any innovation that his vision once had.

364,"James Cameron has come of age in delivering this grand production of an amazing tale, one of the most fascinating true stories around. ""Titanic"" is every bit as good as everyone has been saying. You can see the three hundred million dollars up on the screen. Authenticity is second to none, as new footage is seamlessly faded in from old. Spectacular and awesome to say the least.All the facts and events are so fascinating you hardly need the human story provided. I certainly could have watched this as a documentary. James Cameron has left nothing to chance. I am hard pressed to imagine ""Titanic"" done better.The cast are all spot on and thoroughly enjoyable! Leonardo Di Caprio is the ideal devil-may-care Yankee who wins a ticket to sail to New York. Kate Winslett is perfect as the well-to-do little rich girl who hates her existence and Billy Zane is at his impressive best as the possessive fiancé who is heir to millions. The superlative support cast includes Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Bernard Hill, Johnathan Hyde, Victor Garber, Gloria Stuart and Suzy Amis.Grand, often haunting music is from Cameron regular James Horner. Editing is smart, and the film passes quickly though it is over three hours. The technical team have performed brilliantly, with computer graphics a particular treat. Set decoration (including a near to scale replica and incredibly intricate interiors) and Art Design are both amazing, recreating the most gallant ship of all with unerring grandeur and style. Cinematography sweeps through it all with panache.After viewing this, you'll feel you were there! Don't miss your chance to see this at the movies. I will certainly be boarding again!Saturday, February 28, 1998 - Village Sunshine Gold ClassIn an era basically void of epics, James Cameron has managed to produce a film that measures up with the likes of ""Ben Hur"". Grand, stylish, sweeping and larger than life is the best way to describe this astounding cinematic experience. I freely admit that I was one of the many cynics who, having heard of the film's monstrous budget, thought that ""Titanic"" would be the biggest flop of all time. I, like many, felt this 300 million dollar production would sink faster than the great ship herself.That was not the case, as history will now show, as ""Titanic"" has gone on to smash box office records, collecting a record equalling eleven Academy Awards along the way. The film's visuals alone justify this, with the ship of dreams brought fantastically back to life thanks to some awesome set design, huge scale replicas and access to the original blueprints. Mind blowing special effects, coupled with superior sound editing, make ""Titanic"" a must at the movies (preferably one with Digital Sound and a huge screen).Cameron brings it all together brilliantly, backed up as he is by a thoroughly enjoyable cast, including Leonardo Di Caprio, Kate Winslet, Billy Zane, Bill Paxton and Kathy Bates as the unsinkable Molly Brown. Final master stroke comes from maestro James Horner, whose haunting, beautiful score is the spirit of ""Titanic"", which of course inspired the love theme (a song Jim Cameron never wanted originally) ""My Heart Will Go On"".Saturday, May 30, 1998 - Knox District CentreJim Cameron's grand film of the fateful ""Titanic"" and her maiden voyage loses a great deal of its impact if viewed on anything other than a huge screen. It is still a fascinating tale of how the ship of dreams went to the bottom of the Atlantic for all the wrong reasons.Forget about DiCaprio (miscast) and Winslet (charming), they are mere scenery in a fascinating true story. All those mistakes! Not enough life boats, which weren't filled anyway. Only one boat returning for survivors. Going full speed with virtually zero visibility, no binoculars on the lookout. People locked behind gates below deck, and a seaman who tried to round a giant iceberg in an enormous ship that ""doesn't turn worth a dime"". If the Titanic had've struck head on, it would have stayed afloat.Special effects, sets and costumes are all awesome, but you do really need that huge screen.

365,"Yeah, admitted, I love this movie. Which is nothing to be ashamed of; great movie, great directing, great set, great scale, great canvas, great story. Being a rookie filmmaker myself, I have many inspirations; but among my core favorites are Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Batman (Joel Schumacher aside), and Titanic. Its the quintessential love story, and I don't think there is any particular scene, or even a single shot, that lacks superb creative insight.Given that, I can't bring myself to name a scene that wasn't powerful. True each scene was more powerful than the one before it, but it didn't lessen the awe factor. Visual effects were done as they should be, done so well that its difficult to tell where the line is - digital/real.The score is phenomenal, James Horner provides a compelling score to finally go with a compelling movie. (I mean, lets face it, his work for Jumanji and Troy was good, but the movies lacked). For me, the musical score is one of the four key components to a good movie - good script, good acting, good directing, and good musical score. Thats just my personal analysis. True Celine Dion doesn't do the love theme justice, but the love theme is just the icing on the cake. the opening montages of the ship in all its grandeur made it truly feel like reality. Magnificent, beautiful, with some Irish humor! (admit it, you loved the Irish!!!) Whats not to like about this movie? It takes everything likable about Romeo and Juliet and gives it the backdrop of one of the greatest and most tragic moments in history.

368,"Teenage girls spent an entire summer watching this movie; people flocked to it in unprecedented numbers; the Academy of Motion Pictures completely lost its head and awarded it Best Picture. All for a film that was little more than a poorly-written Harlequin Romance set on the greatest ship to never finish one voyage.This film could have been improved in so many ways:1) Punt the insipid fictional love story and focus on the real-life characters. The supporting cast playing the actual people on board the Titanic was, on the whole, a much better group of actors than the ones in the fictional love story. 2) Have somebody (anybody!) else play the role of Jack. Matt Damon would have been good, Joaquin Phoenix would have been better, but DiCaprio was a huge mistake.3) If DiCaprio is really a must, have him and Billy Zane switch roles. Zane is much better suited to the romantic lead role, and DiCaprio would have been perfect as an unlikeable, self-absorbed fop.4) The Captain should have been portrayed more as he was in real life, not as the confused, incompetent geezer the movie makes him out to be. Witness reports say that Captain Smith acted heroically and with honor; it is a disservice to his memory to portray him as this film does.After all this, I must admit that I did kind of like this movie. I just don't understand all the fuss over it, and I REALLY don't understand why it won the Best Picture Oscar.

369,"Hmm, I wonder what happened at the end? I must have watched 6/8 of this film before washing the dishes seemed a more appealing chore. Many actors can perform convincingly in period films, but this cast did not convince me at all that they were anything but 1990s actors with 1990s dialog trying to look like people from the 1910s. The script was inane, leaving the viewer with only special effects for interest. In the very-near future, when high-tech special effects no longer dazzle audiences, this moneymaking venture will be re-evaluated. I'll give it a 2/10 in order to be fair to the special effects staff, who clearly labored the hardest on this film and deserve some credit.",hmm wonder happen end must watch film wash dish seem appeal chore mani actor perform convincingli period film cast convinc anyth actor dialog tri look like peopl script inan leav viewer special effect interest verynear futur hightech special effect longer dazzl audienc moneymak ventur reevalu ill give order fair special effect staff clearli labor hardest film deserv credit,positive
370,"Titanic has a lot of fans and a lot of detractors. The movie itself is a technical masterpiece. James Cameron showed things that people had never seen before, such as going down into the actual wreckage with this little machine. The movie came out when I was 12, and since I was one of the millions of girls who were head over heels in love with Leonardo DiCaprio, I went to see it four times in the theater.As I said, technically this movie is just brilliant. Some of the technology is a little bit outdated: if you look closely enough, you can pick out the computer images, but I don't think those detract from the visuals. The sets and costumes are absolutely marvelous. The music is also beautiful and haunting, and it's just right for the film's mood. I've always thought that the love theme ""My Heart Will Go On"" is cheesy, but effective in conveying the message of the film.Of course the movie is about the Titanic, but that is really the backdrop for the love-across-class-lines story between Rose DeWitt Bukater and Jack Dawson. When I was 12 of course, this was absolutely fantastic. Now I see it a bit differently, but I do find it appealing nonetheless. The idea is a little bit ludicrous considering how the ship was built and isolated the upper class from those in steerage. A woman being able to break away from that is also pretty doubtful, but nonetheless if you can get over that you can see the love story for what it is, and that its message is love transcends all obstacles. This is a great movie to watch on a Saturday afternoon when it's rainy outside and you've got nothing better to do.Aside from the love story you have the entire tragic loss of life from the sinking of the ship. I think this was both well-done by Cameron visually and the viewer sees the absurdity of course in Rose's jumping off the lifeboat to return to Jack. Again though we understand as an audience that we're going to be experiencing the foundering of this ship through the eyes of our two star-cross'd lovers, so the audience just has to roll with the punches here. Some of the shots here are amazing, and it gets a little ghastly when the ship breaks in half and people start falling off and hitting propellers and getting landed on by the stern of the ship.The dialogue in this movie, however, is far from stellar. The worst parts are the modern day pieces with Gloria Stewart and Bill Paxton's acting is as flat as the Great Plains. Again you just have to roll with the punches to get to the good stuff, which is all the material when they're on the Titanic. Billy Zane makes a great villain, and so does Frances Fisher as the mother. Kate Winslet I think did an excellent job given some of her lines are a bit dull, but I think she still pulls it off convincingly. Leonardo DiCaprio is also a good actor, and although some of his lines are terrible, you can see in him the youth and vibrancy that a poor young artist must have when he's gotten the chance of a lifetime.It's interesting to look at the roles of these women too, as Rose is not portrayed as a damsel in distress, but more of a young woman who's confused and angry and trapped in her upper class world. While it may sound like a poor little rich girl story, Kate Winslet convinces you that it's not just about her resenting her position in society. If you were Rose, you'd be unhappy too.Overall I still love this movie. It's a great disaster film and has a lot of those classic elements. The direction and the sets and costumes are visually dazzling, and some of the acting is not superb, but overall I still say it's a good movie. It's definitely worth watching once, if only for the sets and the sinking of the ship.",titan lot fan lot detractor movi technic masterpiec jame cameron show thing peopl never seen go actual wreckag littl machin movi came sinc one million girl head heel love leonardo dicaprio went see four time theatera said technic movi brilliant technolog littl bit outdat look close enough pick comput imag dont think detract visual set costum absolut marvel music also beauti haunt right film mood ive alway thought love theme heart go cheesi effect convey messag filmof cours movi titan realli backdrop loveacrossclasslin stori rose dewitt bukat jack dawson cours absolut fantast see bit differ find appeal nonetheless idea littl bit ludicr consid ship built isol upper class steerag woman abl break away also pretti doubt nonetheless get see love stori messag love transcend obstacl great movi watch saturday afternoon raini outsid youv got noth better doasid love stori entir tragic loss life sink ship think welldon cameron visual viewer see absurd cours rose jump lifeboat return jack though understand audienc go experienc founder ship eye two starcrossd lover audienc roll punch shot amaz get littl ghastli ship break half peopl start fall hit propel get land stern shipth dialogu movi howev far stellar worst part modern day piec gloria stewart bill paxton act flat great plain roll punch get good stuff materi theyr titan billi zane make great villain franc fisher mother kate winslet think excel job given line bit dull think still pull convincingli leonardo dicaprio also good actor although line terribl see youth vibranc poor young artist must he gotten chanc lifetimeit interest look role woman rose portray damsel distress young woman who confus angri trap upper class world may sound like poor littl rich girl stori kate winslet convinc resent posit societi rose youd unhappi toooveral still love movi great disast film lot classic element direct set costum visual dazzl act superb overal still say good movi definit worth watch set sink ship,positive

In Titanic two people that seem nothing a like at all fall in love and it changes everything that could have happened. This movie also shows that you can get something good out of something bad. These two were about to die if they kept waiting on each other and instead of saving themselves they waited for each other. This movie also helps explain what was really happening on the ship and how separated it really was.

Even when mythbusters did it they seem to try to be as accurate as possible but what they missed is by jack staying off it that is why kept rose as dry as possible when the busters did stuff to get position just right and even tied the life best on the door I can tell you that it would have been more then extremely difficult to do that in north Atlantic freezing water your ha d do not work well and if they had to take there time in life suits if jack kept forcing rose in the water to safe himself he would have killed her as well the busters did a test that if jack was able to get out of the water immediately he would have barely survived just barely! Meaning if he even made her fall in o e or two times she would not have survived let alone probably 7 or more times the busters fell in and the door would have been sitting a few inches I. The water at that temp it would have more then enough to kill her. So I believe the way it happe. Was well thought out and orchestrated.

374,"Titanic is a fairly good movie, but I personally think the historical part of the movie seemed to be more touching and overall better then the love story between Jack and Rose. Their relationship seemed to have all of the aspects that every Hollywood romantic-fantasy has: the two young lovers are breaking the social code to be seeing each other, they're both young enough to pass as teenagers..(which, in this film, I think they are) , there is a steamy scene, and it has a touch of tragedy. Well, it's all very predictable but James Cameron did a wonderful job with the story of the ship Titanic. I found that part more touching and realistic than the love story. You really can see the passenger's terror and panic during the sinking sequence. Its all very saddening to watch because, as you watch it, you know that it actually happened many years ago. The amount of detail put into it was incredible, from the ""woman and children first, first class first"" to the musicians staying aboard to play, the fireworks... all very nice to watch.",titan fairli good movi person think histor part movi seem touch overal better love stori jack rose relationship seem aspect everi hollywood romanticfantasi two young lover break social code see theyr young enough pas teenagerswhich film think steami scene touch tragedi well predict jame cameron wonder job stori ship titan found part touch realist love stori realli see passeng terror panic sink sequenc sadden watch watch know actual happen mani year ago amount detail put incred woman child first first class first musician stay aboard play firework nice watch,positive

377,"For a long time, I hated this movie.  The drawn out scenes, the ridiculous plot line, the horrible script, the melodramatic acting, and to top it all off, an annoying ballad to accompany this poor excuse for a feature film. Nevertheless, this movie enthralled some moviegoers to sit through it four of five times.  Could I have been that wrong about the biggest box office hit in history?The answer is no.  Although I have seen the movie for a second time and now more clearly realize how remarkable the visual effects truly are, I can't let go of everything else.Kate Winslet actually received an Oscar nomination for her flat, uninteresting portrayal of Rose and people were really upset that she lost? I find this hard to believe considering that Winslet came off in this film like she ordered her SAG card off of the Home Shopping Network.  Also, her pairing with DiCaprio was as odd as Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggie, only without the on-screen chemistry of the famous puppets.The two interesting characters in this whole shipwreck,  didn't even receive the recognition they deserved in my opinion.  Billy Zane and Kathy Bates were the only people keeping me awake and they were ignored while Gloria Stuart received a nomination for playing a role my grandmother could have better demonstrated.Best Picture?  I think not.  However, Titanic does deserve every award it has received for visual effects and art direction.  I'm also willing to agree with the Academy in choosing James Cameron as Best Director. Nonetheless, this movie does not have the ingredients to be considered the Best Picture of 1997 let alone of all time.  Perhaps if I watch it a third time?

379,"I know there is a million respones already written, but I just can't help letting some readers know that this is not by all means a great film. There was one moment that caught my breath.  I don't believe J Cameron intended this scene to be though.  It was when Jack said he was from Chippewa Falls (WI). Since I am from WI, this line made me enjoy the movie for a few seconds. If that was the only scene I liked, well this film will be and is in big trouble.Ok there are a few things that weren't bad.  1. Kathy Bates (should have been nominated for the statue) 2. a likeable theme in music.  3. good opening scene(it was pretty spectacular)Now, the rest I have to say are for the Titanic freaks.1.  This script was beyond pathetic.  Cameron trys to be touchy by having two completely different people fall in love.  True, they could have been made for each other, but the way Cameron incorporated all the scenes were hideous. The script of the present time is decent, but the story telling part is horrible.  I couldn't get rid of the feeling of numbness in my butt. 2.  Acting was for the most part not good (except Bates).  Winslet is the worst.  She could not get me to feel for her.  Her jumping scene is simply boring.  Leo- was better, but still did make me feel like he is in love with her.  And please, Leo can't lift her when she fell over. Maybe that's why we never saw them together in the scene. 3.  The graphics- ok it was pretty neat how they sank the ship.  But the scenes never made me feel like I was on that ship.  The boat was very fake. Plus the water looked like a giant swimming pool.  And the sky looks like something I drew in kindergarten.  Just look back at other movies. Jurassic Park had much better graphics. 4.  Music-  I am a music major, and James Horner is not a composer I admire. He developed a fairly interesting theme.  But he never went anywhere with it.  All the music seemed to be in the same mood. Finally, story.....it was simply boring.  No one will ever beat Spielberg or Lucas in telling a story.Cameron should have stuck to his T2 or T3.  Stay away from other genres. All the films nominated in 97 were better than Titanic.  I thought Amistad should have won it, but that's my taste.

Fast forward to 2012, & I saw this yet again, on the big screen for the 100th Anniversary of the actual ships sinking & found it to be great. I saw this again for the actual films 25th anniversary & found it even more great than before having not seen it in years.The film sees a young man, Jack Dawson, an artist who boards the Titanic along with 17 year old, Rose, who is set to be married, but falls in with Jack. However, the ship in which they board hits an ice berg & it is then they find themselves along with the other 2198 passengers stranded in the middle of the Atlantic.I found the film to be great. It's very well written & directed with my only complaint being that it's too long & drags quite a bit at 3 hours & 7 minutes. The drama & romance are great as with the action parts we see involving the lateral half of the film which does keep you glued as the 2 main leads try to survive & stick together through carnage that unfolds.As I said, the film did hold your interest but was too long & dragged at points, when the action does kick in, you are sat there wondering what will happen, even if you have seen 1000 times. There's some eye candy with Kate Winslet & we see Leonardo Di Caprio in his early days of acting, both actors do well with their parts as do the others. But the film could've been sped up at points & edited to be below 3 hours at least by 30-45 minutes.Overall, it's a great film. It's sad, intense & has some funny moments for the 3 hours & 7 minutes it runs. However, despite the action, eye candy & drama, the film is too long & drawn out & could've been shorten down by 30-45 minutes & sped up in areas.

390,"After watching Titanic ONCE, many things went through my mind.  People see this as a masterpiece while I see this movie as another above-average movie. I felt like going to the restroom after staying in my seat for more than three and a half hours (counting trailers). One glaring aspect I personally do not like is Cameron's portrayal of the third class passengers being locked in their area.  This did not really happen in the true story of the Titanic.  Many famous people died on the ship and Cameron does not refer to this.  Instead, he plays on people's emotions to make them feel sorry for the third class passengers' misfortunes. Another setback I saw in the movie was DiCaprio's less than average acting performance.  He was not nominated for Best Actor for a reason and Kate Winslet was a poor match to put with him.  She looked a lot older than DiCaprio and her better acting ability made DiCaprio's acting look even more disparaging. Even with the movie hoopla, the teenage girl infatuations of DiCaprio, and the great box-office records it broke, Titanic is not one of the best movies of all time, but good enough for a night with a loved one.",watch titan mani thing went mind peopl see masterpiec see movi anoth aboveaverag movi felt like go restroom stay seat three half hour count trailer one glare aspect person like cameron portray third class passeng lock area realli happen true stori titan mani famou peopl die ship cameron refer instead play peopl emot make feel sorri third class passeng misfortun anoth setback saw movi dicaprio le averag act perform nomin best actor reason kate winslet poor match put look lot older dicaprio better act abil made dicaprio act look even disparag even movi hoopla teenag girl infatu dicaprio great boxoffic record broke titan one best movi time good enough night love one,positive

392,"Titanic is a 1997 film directed by James Cameron, who also wrote the screenplay and co-produced the film. The film is based on the historical event of the sinking of the RMS Titanic, the largest and most luxurious passenger ship of its time, which collided with an iceberg on its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York in 1912. The film focuses on the fictional romance between two passengers from different social classes: Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio), a poor artist who won a ticket in a poker game, and Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet), a wealthy aristocrat who is engaged to a ruthless tycoon, Cal Hockley (Billy Zane).The film depicts the fateful journey of the Titanic, from its departure to its tragic demise, and the experiences of the passengers and crew on board. The film also portrays the social and historical context of the early 20th century, such as the class divisions, the women's suffrage movement, and the technological innovations. The film is a stunning visual feast, with impressive sets, costumes, and special effects that recreate the Titanic and its surroundings with remarkable realism and detail. The film also features a memorable musical score by James Horner, and the iconic theme song ""My Heart Will Go On"" by Celine Dion, which won an Oscar for Best Original Song.The film is not only a technical marvel, but also a powerful and emotional drama, that explores the themes of love, courage, sacrifice, and survival. The film draws the audience into the lives and fates of the characters, and makes them care about their hopes and dreams, their joys and sorrows, their choices and actions. The film also raises ethical and moral questions, such as the responsibility of the ship's owners and officers, the value of human life, and the meaning of death. The film is a tribute to the Titanic and its passengers, and a reminder of the fragility and preciousness of life.Titanic is a film that has captivated and moved millions of viewers around the world, and has become one of the most successful and acclaimed films of all time. It won 11 Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director, and is currently the third-highest-grossing film of all time, behind Avatar and Avengers: Endgame.

Now I understand that I must give some credit to Mr. Cameron for spending WAY too much on minor details (such as the ships's engine) which could have easily been avoided.  This is the obvious case of a man who needs to spend as much money as possible for publicity? Anyone remember the last time that stunt was pulled?  It was called ""Waterworld"" - and was equally as bad and chessy.  The only difference was that ""Waterworld"" did not take place around a real event - and that is the ONLY reason Titanic won Best Picture, oh and how I can forget the ludicrous special effects!!!

397,"""Titanic"", a movie based on an obscure footnote of maritime history, is a mixed bag of a movie.  On the one hand there's the amazing visuals, the intense attention to historical detail, commendable performances and to top it all off, a nude scene with Kate Winslet.  On the other hand this movie has a sub-par script and a cliche of a plot, coupled with stereotypical, one-dimensional characters and a three-hour running time.  Even when you factor in the surprise ending (hint: it involves an iceberg) this film is far from ""the greatest ever""; in fact, I wouldn't put it in my top thirty.

399,"In 1912, humanity cried that ""Not even God himself could sink the Titanic"", the 'ship of dreams'; the indestructible symbol of mankind's modern achievements in maritime and industrialization. In 1998, celebrity cried that ""Not even God himself could sink the Academy awards and hyperbole of fame and recognition that was the film about the events 80 years earlier"".Well, look at it this way: Not even the divine and mighty God himself needed to sink the ship nor the film. Both the ship and its eponymous film representation sank after strong initial hype due to their paying comeuppance for pride and folly and getting found out of their own excesses in the long run. To begin with, the true story remains tragic because of the very fact that mankind overlooked, arrogantly so, the realities- failing to prepare (lifeboats a waste of deck space, class struggles, racism, rich & poor divides). In the end, mankind (regardless of whether the rich or poor caused the problems) paid the price of collective folly.The film, likewise, pays the price regardless of whether the executives who force-sold the distribution and caused the film to gain such unprecedented hype and reviews at first seemed so successful, really cared about more the bottom line. The film may have succeeded financially, but to me it still sank in the longer run. It made for a great emotional journey at first, but really, as we have to critique it at the level given its accolades, is nothing spectacular compared to something Capra-corn -'It's a Wonderful Life', which is emotionally powerful yet never gets cheesy.And, just like the real ship on her maiden voyage, it started off to controversy, followed by fanfare, and then tragedy. The reel version, nearly collapsed in budget controversy and then was bolstered by the biggest PR campaign complete with critics-wooing parties in the hopes of buying it around, thrusting the film as the most overpriced and embellished multi-million Hollywood machine- which turned off many and caused many more around the world to realize it for what it was- commercialism. Granted, that it's also a movie that because of its fame pervasive invasion on pop culture caused and still causes many to have an opinion about it (i.e. herd mentality discrediting/accrediting of the film along the lines of majority sentiment), I'll suggest that these ramifications of the film do not determine the film's genuine buoyancy. By buoyancy, I'm talking about the film's long term standing in the realms of other all time accredited films- the test if it really is a masterpiece.Of course, my entire dialogue here is based on the premise that because it swept awards, it has been rated a 'great film', of which I disagree with. I think the movie is found out upon repeat viewing, and I think even the majority of its fans (again remember to strip away the hype and the Leo Mania) don't really rate it as a great film per se. Plus, even here in the IMDb, why is the movie not recognized as a great film years after the initial awards fever? Because it has been found out over time for what it is- a decent film that stood out for its historical recreation (not facts in its entirety), and weaved alongside a trite love story on board the ship of fools, albeit being panoramic-ally beautiful. There are strong positives of course- special effects as well as sound and editing. But as you can see, they are all technical aspects, not in terms of classical film art.The film is a meticulous recreation and that is why I gave it 7/10, but it is not a GREAT film as say an intellectually challenging Fellini satirical commentary like 'And the Ship sails On'. It was panoramic-ally beautiful and had great costume design but it did not have, say, brilliant mise en scene that gives it nuance. In that sense, it is certainly not deserving of all of its accolades and accreditation.Nonetheless, I do not dispute its garnering gargantuan box office revenue worldwide as that was FOX's ultimate goal (even if Cameron had a personal crusade of sub-marine discovery). Essentially, when you wash away the DiCaprio mania (not to be discounted because it tied in substantial box office receipts), the hullabaloo of Oscar accreditation & aggressive marketing/advertising campaigns (successful from Bangkok to Rio DeJaneiro or HongKong might I add), you're left with a film that got found out as a victim of its own showy hype.Thus, film critics could never call it anymore than it was: popcorn fodder, and once teenagers outgrew their crushes, and people had witnessed the beautiful recreation of the ill-fated voyage that declared its pomp 80 years earlier, there was nothing left of this ship. It lies at the bottom of the sea save for nostalgic divers who yearn to return to their old sentiments, have issues to deal with or are disillusioned by the hype of past tragedy.Not even God himself needed to sink the ship or the film, there wasn't anything in it, unless people take the real message of what we can learn from Titanic: Respect God, be prepared, love and treat your fellow humans as equals, fight oppression, class segregation, battle the rich poor divide, celebrate freedom, and above all, to not get caught up in the excesses and hype of initial success. What we can learn from Titanic is that as pirated copies of the film are sold in Afghanistan or Cambodia by child slaves, the real tragedy in the world today is that we should focus not on the 1700 people who died, but turn our attention to the millions dying annually of inequalities. Marx or Kafka could probably tell us that you don't need God himself to remind us of that by sinking ships, and or, mass marketed popcorn billion dollar films.By Stephen Thanabalan",human cri even god could sink titan ship dream indestruct symbol mankind modern achiev maritim industri celebr cri even god could sink academi award hyperbol fame recognit film event year earlierwel look way even divin mighti god need sink ship film ship eponym film represent sank strong initi hype due pay comeupp pride folli get found excess long run begin true stori remain tragic fact mankind overlook arrogantli realiti fail prepar lifeboat wast deck space class struggl racism rich poor divid end mankind regardless whether rich poor caus problem paid price collect follyth film likewis pay price regardless whether execut forcesold distribut caus film gain unpreced hype review first seem success realli care bottom line film may succeed financi still sank longer run made great emot journey first realli critiqu level given accolad noth spectacular compar someth capracorn wonder life emot power yet never get cheesyand like real ship maiden voyag start controversi follow fanfar tragedi reel version nearli collaps budget controversi bolster biggest pr campaign complet criticswoo parti hope buy around thrust film overpr embellish multimillion hollywood machin turn mani caus mani around world realiz commerci grant also movi fame pervas invas pop cultur caus still caus mani opinion ie herd mental discreditingaccredit film along line major sentiment ill suggest ramif film determin film genuin buoyanc buoyanc im talk film long term stand realm time accredit film test realli masterpieceof cours entir dialogu base premis swept award rate great film disagre think movi found upon repeat view think even major fan rememb strip away hype leo mania dont realli rate great film per se plu even imdb movi recogn great film year initi award fever found time decent film stood histor recreat fact entireti weav alongsid trite love stori board ship fool albeit panoram beauti strong posit cours special effect well sound edit see technic aspect term classic film artth film meticul recreat gave great film say intellectu challeng fellini satir commentari like ship sail panoram beauti great costum design say brilliant mise en scene give nuanc sen certainli deserv accolad accreditationnonetheless disput garner gargantuan box offic revenu worldwid fox ultim goal even cameron person crusad submarin discoveri essenti wash away dicaprio mania discount tie substanti box offic receipt hullabaloo oscar accredit aggress marketingadvertis campaign success bangkok rio dejaneiro hongkong might add your left film got found victim showi hypethu film critic could never call anymor popcorn fodder teenag outgrew crush peopl wit beauti recreat illfat voyag declar pomp year earlier noth left ship lie bottom sea save nostalg diver yearn return old sentiment issu deal disillus hype past tragedynot even god need sink ship film wasnt anyth unless peopl take real messag learn titan respect god prepar love treat fellow human equal fight oppress class segreg battl rich poor divid celebr freedom get caught excess hype initi success learn titan pirat copi film sold afghanistan cambodia child slave real tragedi world today focu peopl die turn attent million die annual inequ marx kafka could probabl tell u dont need god remind u sink ship mass market popcorn billion dollar filmsbi stephen thanabalan,positive

The man did not only manage to put to use a $202,000,000 budget, capture never before built sets, but on top of all that he had to show us characters, feelings, stories, lives and the ultimate fate of a doomed liner.

After hearing ""You'll be in my heart"" for the 1,496th time (yes, I really did count. I was really bored one month), i got really tired of it, to say the least.

403,"The movie opens as researchers try to find out diamonds inside the wreck of the real titanic, which gives us the first full look of the wreck of the unsinkable ship which was a bit emotional. Bill Paxton finds 85 years old diary which hold the drawing of the naked women & then later on it's been telecast on TV. The movie goes into flashback & here comes the glimpse of the beautiful ship titanic. The bunch of characters appear in the movie at the port of Belfast, which also includes the male leading start Leonardo winning the ticket of titanic on the lucky hand of poker. The movie literally gives you the feeling of viewer being inside of the ship & according to the facts everything in the movie is been re-designed from the furniture to the decks, lamps, the door way, life boats, & along with the engine room.The real movie beings after Rose decides to suicide jumping from the rear end of the ship & Jack take her mind off the track & saves her. As the movie continues Jack & Rose starts to meet up regularly at the different parts of the ship, while on the other hand Rose mother & her fiancé Cal doesn't like Rose spending time with lower class standard jack, but still young hearts were attracted to each other. The best scene in the movie according to me is the flying scene of Jack & Rose, which makes rose realize that she is in love with Jack too. The movie takes sudden turns when on the same night titanic hits the iceberg, which in short left my eyes wide open, as it has been directed & executed very well, & then the final chapter of the maiden voyage beings the sinking of the unsinkable titanic. The final hour of the movie filled with reality & the disaster which people till now hasn't forgotten. People struggling to survive & the real history how traveler's were saved into the life boats are the key scenes of the movie. Some true scenes like the Creator of titanic Thomas Andrews died while standing near the dining clock & was last seen, the steamer falling on the jacks brother, third class traveler's were treated during the sinking scenes. The breaking apart of ship are the most shattering scenes in the movie. There is no doubt even today in 2012 still I wonder what James Cameron has achieved in the special effects put into this movie, the year 1997 the worked on their best special effects effort to keep this movie alive even for the upcoming generation to watch on. The soul of the movie is the background score of this motion picture which is composed by James Horner every piece of music is been composed specially to suit the scenes of this movie itself, from the opening sequence to de-porting of titanic to Rose theme & the sinking sequence. James Cameron specially recorded the score of the movie with real orchestra the team of James Horner. In one the interviews of the making of Avatar one of the viewer asked him "" what if you get a chance to direct Titanic again, what would be your experience in making it "" ?? and he answer if I would have been given a change to direct titanic again, I will finish titanic within a month very easily cause of hugely availability of special effects team, cause for titanic I had to wait for some shot for days. For example the shot of Rose & Jack on the front end of the ship kissing each other, he had to wait for days to get proper sunset in the camera as special effects that time weren't that advanced like how they are today. In one word you're a legend Cameron. The wreck shot of ship were taken in the year 1995 2 years before the releasing the movie into theaters. Till now whenever I watch this movie I still feel I'm watching it for the first time & somewhere there are tears in my eyes specially in the scene where rose steps into the life boats & Jacks watches her going away, oh geez that particular scene gets tears in my eyes every time. I am now waiting for the special edition of this movie to be released in 3d blu-ray. True facts about TITANIC Titanic was constructed to be unsinkable ship of that time, but the creator of the ship Thomas made 3 biggest mistakes in constructing the ship. The propeller of the ship were taken directly from the design of the 18's century cruise liner, the water tight compartments had one the major flaws which over flowed the water from the upper decks, the propellers turning radius was not designed to turn ship quickly as the ship size was way bigger than the propellers could bear it during the full stern. On the night of sinking titanic received 5 iceberg warning, but still they ignored the warning & continue sailing. The final decision by the Mr Murdoch to reverse the engines & turning the ship to evade iceberg. The decision not to carry enough life boats cause it ruins the overall look of the top deck & it was initially decided to carry just 8 life boats, but later on more 12 boats were added. The distress call from titanic was actually received by the local streamer waiting for the morning to sail again couldn't reach for help as the streamer couldn't see the titanic as the sky was full of twinkling stars which interrupted the them to see through binoculars.The crew lost their binoculars on the night ship hitted the iceberg.My rating – 10/10 !!!!!!!",movi open research tri find diamond insid wreck real titan give u first full look wreck unsink ship bit emot bill paxton find year old diari hold draw nake woman later telecast tv movi goe flashback come glimps beauti ship titan bunch charact appear movi port belfast also includ male lead start leonardo win ticket titan lucki hand poker movi liter give feel viewer insid ship accord fact everyth movi redesign furnitur deck lamp door way life boat along engin roomth real movi be rose decid suicid jump rear end ship jack take mind track save movi continu jack rose start meet regularli differ part ship hand rose mother fianc cal doesnt like rose spend time lower class standard jack still young heart attract best scene movi accord fli scene jack rose make rose realiz love jack movi take sudden turn night titan hit iceberg short left eye wide open direct execut well final chapter maiden voyag be sink unsink titan final hour movi fill realiti disast peopl till hasnt forgotten peopl struggl surviv real histori travel save life boat key scene movi true scene like creator titan thoma andrew die stand near dine clock last seen steamer fall jack brother third class travel treat sink scene break apart ship shatter scene movi doubt even today still wonder jame cameron achiev special effect put movi year work best special effect effort keep movi aliv even upcom gener watch soul movi background score motion pictur compos jame horner everi piec music compos special suit scene movi open sequenc deport titan rose theme sink sequenc jame cameron special record score movi real orchestra team jame horner one interview make avatar one viewer ask get chanc direct titan would experi make answer would given chang direct titan finish titan within month easili caus huge avail special effect team caus titan wait shot day exampl shot rose jack front end ship kiss wait day get proper sunset camera special effect time werent advanc like today one word your legend cameron wreck shot ship taken year year releas movi theater till whenev watch movi still feel im watch first time somewher tear eye special scene rose step life boat jack watch go away oh geez particular scene get tear eye everi time wait special edit movi releas bluray true fact titan titan construct unsink ship time creator ship thoma made biggest mistak construct ship propel ship taken directli design centuri cruis liner water tight compart one major flaw flow water upper deck propel turn radiu design turn ship quickli ship size way bigger propel could bear full stern night sink titan receiv iceberg warn still ignor warn continu sail final decis mr murdoch revers engin turn ship evad iceberg decis carri enough life boat caus ruin overal look top deck initi decid carri life boat later boat ad distress call titan actual receiv local streamer wait morn sail couldnt reach help streamer couldnt see titan sky full twinkl star interrupt see binocularsth crew lost binocular night ship hit icebergmi rate,positive
404,"I just went into the movie theatre to see my all time favourite movie, Titanic by James Cameron, in all its brilliance.It's just like those 15 years have never happened. It's so utterly sweeping to watch this huge vessel rising up in the screen. Cameron outstandingly managed to shoot his sequences comparing sizes against each other which - by their contrast - brings so much emotion to something we only perceive in real life: size.After watching the movie, I can't believe this is a 2D to 3D conversion. This is not just a diorama kind of 3D conversion; watching the movie it's hard to believe it was not shot in 3D originally. Even in real life action scenes Cameron stems the task of creating realistic 3D perspective throughout the movie. It must have been hell to mesh all the fringes in each and every of the frames. Well, as I learned now, it took 60 weeks and 18 Million dollars to work on this. That gamble payed off very well.Not to mention all the emotion that comes with the story. Cameron is a wizard of timing. One moment the audience is just deeply moved by romance, when it gets torn out right the next moment by fear, anger or laugh.This is a very emotional film. There are so many different fates one can as easily think his/her way into. In 1997 I have been crying about what I saw in a movie - I was baffled, because this happened for the first time in my life... Now in 2012 I was crying, laughing, fearing so much all the way again, together with my girl friend.We personally feel so much like Rose and Jack. There are so many details in the movie that match our situation, up to tiny things like dancing barefoot or the butterfly as a symbol for freedom at heart and escape from family's restrictions.To all those who don't like the movie, here's my advice: NEVER watch this film on TV! You can only appreciate this precious work of art in a movie theatre. - I never saw this movie on TV and I never will.

405,"Who says that old fashioned romantic films don't sell. They certainly do if they're done right as the story in Titanic certainly is.This blockbuster version of the most famous shipwreck in history is a homage to Maytime. In fact in casting Gloria Stuart as old Rose through whose eyes we see the disaster unfold, Director James Cameron went back to a contemporary of Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy.The film begins with the discovery of the wreck of the Titanic in the middle Eighties which did cause great excitement at the time. Searching the wreck divers come upon a safe and a nude portrait of a woman wearing a necklace with a diamond thought to be lost and the portrait is dated April 14, 1912. The woman is still alive and its Gloria Stuart who tells her tale the way an aged Jeanette MacDonald did in Maytime.Winning a card game that got him a third class passage aboard the maiden voyage of Titanic, itinerant artist Leonardo DiCaprio gets on board the vessel. He meets and woos a younger version of Gloria Stuart who is played by Kate Winslet. Unfortunately she's about to enter a loveless marriage for money urged on by her mother, Frances Fisher, who wants her declining years not be spent in the poorhouse. Her prospective fiancé is Billy Zane a rather arrogant young robber baron heir of his time who has a factotum/bodyguard in David Warner who has one of the best roles in the film. Still Leo and Kate get a few stolen hours of romance before the disaster strikes.One thing that James Cameron did is that he never allowed the spectacle of the disaster nor even the issues of wealth and class that were omnipresent in the Titanic story to overwhelm his romantic leads. In fact they are an integral part of the story as young Leo reaches for what was unobtainable.Leonardo DiCaprio remarked that his part of Jack was the least complex role he ever did. The part is a romantic lead, the guy has no secrets or hidden issues, he's just a young man in love. Maybe that was the reason he was not nominated for Best Actor in the face of all those nominations Titanic did get. It won for Best Picture and Best Director and a flock of Oscars in the technical area. Kate Winslet and Gloria Stuart were nominated and lost for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress respectively.Titanic is a story that's been filmed since the silent days almost in the wake of the disaster itself. The Germans made a propaganda film of it in 1943 which Nazi inspired though it was, did make a few points against the British upper classes and that the first class got saved and those in steerage mostly drowned. There was a fine version in 1953 with Clifton Webb and Barbara Stanwyck as an older married couple with problems on the doomed ship. And the British did the classic, A Night to Remember which is a documentary like recreation from the ship's officers point of view.Still they'll have to go some beat this one.

407,"I did not like Titanic. I thought the acting was way way way over the top, it definitely was not historically accurate, and the whole old-woman-with-the-valuable-necklace thing was just way too over the top. I am a fan of Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet (I think she's maybe the best actress working today in films) but I couldn't stand this movie. The fact that is was so very over-hyped to me by my girlfriend at the time who saw it with her friends before dragging me to go see it did not help probably. The action was pretty good with great effects of the boat sailing the ocean and especially during the sinking scenes, but it felt very long and was trying way too hard to pluck at heartstrings. I don't understand why the leads had to have the fate that they did, don't want to spoil it but if you've seen it I think you know what I mean when I say why couldn't she share the furniture?

408,"Possibly one of the most overrated films of all time. Mind you, I am not a Titanic hater. I saw the movie, and I cried, and was moved. The sinking scene was heartbreaking. However... For all the hype, the movie isn't that high quality. A sadly cliched story, sub-par acting, historical inaccuracies, and gratuitous use of plot devices is hidden under beautiful scenery, costumes, and great special effects. It's your depressingly average story of rich girl meets poor guy, runs off, parents disapprove, evil boyfriend lurks in background. Quite possibly the best proof of the weak script is the fact that, as you watch the boat sink, and as all the characters' fates come together, it is not Jack and Rose your heart goes out to, but rather the random extras running around, falling off of things, and being trapped insidee the boat. In this, to some degree, there was success. One of the most powerful images in the movie is an old couple just lying on their bed while water floods in beneath them. Again, this movie isn't awful. It's actually pretty good. But it certainly didn't deserve the eight million Academy Awards it recieved. Costumes, yes. Special effects, sound editing, sure. It was all very well put-together. But in the categories of character and plot, where it matters most, the movie falls apart. Even the more recent Pearl Harbor, also hailed for its messy plot, is well-acted and powerful, and you at least LIKE the characters. The powerful performances hold it together. Next time you're at the video store, I'd reccomend Pearl Harbor over Titanic any time. However, Titanic still is not to be missed.

Firstly there are no spoilers in this review, so don't worry.I thought the main characters acting was poor, Kate Winslet really shown up in her worst film to date (pity, because Heavenly Creatures was so good) and Leonardo DiCaprio was nothing special compared to his performance in 'Man in the Iron Mask,' which was very good. However, some of the supporting characters did very well, and it was from them that the emotion was created. You really got a sense of terror and helplessness that they felt, without being clouded by very corny dialogue, like the lead characters were.The special effects were magnificant, well done to them. Definately a cinema film with plenty of stunning visuals, long shots and wide pan angles.  The ship looked fantastic and realistic.  The effects had to be good, otherwise I think the film would have sank without trace, and James Camereon would be mourning his lost millions for a long time to come.

The real message of this movie is that if we knew what would happen tomorrow, there would be no point in living. We just have to take things as they come because there is no predicting what tomorrow will hold. So basically, caution is life's curse.

In my opinion, the best movie ever made is Gone With the Wind.  You just can't compare to such an epic.  Titanic doesn't even come close.

420,"The cinema viewer may well wonder whether there can be any real suspense when it is clear from the beginning of the film that the central character, Rose (Kate Winslet), will survive the disaster that befalls the Titanic. But suspense there is, not least because we don't know whether her lover will make it. There is also action, social (class) comment, drama, historical notes - not least several comments on the cause of the initial impact and why it was so disastrous - and good old fashioned romance.Rarely has a three hour film seemed so short. It canters. The romance at the centre of the plot develops quickly and my attention was held not only by developments in this story but the events that, taken together, spelt disaster for the 'unsinkable' ship, and then the aftermath of the ship's collision with that famous iceberg.Kate Winslet was simply gorgeous and put in a fine performance, as did Leonardo di Caprio as Jack Dawson. The make-up of the older Rose (Gloria Stuart) was one of the less convincing aspects of the movie, but it seems churlish to draw attention to such a detail; in any case, it's to be expected that an 87 year old will need a fair amount of facial recontouring and war-paint to play a woman of 101.",cinema viewer may well wonder whether real suspens clear begin film central charact rose kate winslet surviv disast befal titan suspens least dont know whether lover make also action social class comment drama histor note least sever comment caus initi impact disastr good old fashion romancerar three hour film seem short canter romanc centr plot develop quickli attent held develop stori event taken togeth spelt disast unsink ship aftermath ship collis famou icebergk winslet simpli gorgeou put fine perform leonardo di caprio jack dawson makeup older rose gloria stuart one le convinc aspect movi seem churlish draw attent detail case expect year old need fair amount facial recontour warpaint play woman,positive

423,"Titanic is NOT the best film ever. In fact, it's not even the best film of '97. But it's a great movie. The visual effects are amazing, but some of the acting is awful (Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, and especially Billy Zane). The last 1 1/2 hours of it are an emotional powerhouse, but a LOT of the dialogue is cheesy. Also, it made me angry that Leo, Kate, and Gloria Stuart (she was good, but not great) got all the acting spotlight shined on them, when it was Kathy Bates' finely tuned performance that stole every scene and showed that she can truly do everything an actress can do and more. The Billy Zane character was poorly written, poorly acted, and poorly conceived. All he was missing was a pencil-thin mustache and an evil laugh. There was a lot of talk about how bad the script was. The script was great. Sure, the dialogue sucked, but dialogue is about 10% of a screenplay. And storytelling is the other 90%. James Cameron's storytelling abilities are, today, only matched by Spielberg's.Something I really hated about it was when everyone compared it to Gone With the Wind. What is up with that?!?!?!?! Sure, there are some similarities in the plot, but Gone with the Wind is regarded by many as the best movie ever and a classic. There is no awful dialogue. There are no awful , one-dimensional characters. There are no bad performances. It's just full of good old-fashioned Hollywood storytelling at its best. It is more entertaining than Titanic, too. It is a half an hour longer, but holds your attention even better than Titanic ever could. Plus, if you take into account inflation, Gone With the Wind made twice as much as Titanic in America alone.

429,"A fictional romantic story rapping itself up in a true tragedy.Cameron goes to all the work on the detail of the set and overlooks the time period.

430,"This unconvincing love-story wrapped around a human disaster made a fairly average Hollywood Blockbuster.  The characters were 1 dimensional stereotypes and utterly unrealistic, perhaps best summarised by the moment in which Billy Zane crumbles beneath the weight of traditional Hollywood narrative conventions and pulls a gun on the young lovers.  Did people really believe that?  The action is average, the acting okay, the drama tedious, the special effects a dime a dozen these days, and the ending PREDICTABLE.

435,"The Greatest film of all time? HMMM.I vowed to never watch the film, but I did. What a waste of time and 2 video cassettes. I did give the film a chance. I am a James Cameron fan, I own all of his other films on cassette. What can I say. The film was boring, the acting was horrible. DiCaprio was laughingly bad, and he actually thought he deserved an Oscar nod. Billy Zane played the best character in the film, honestly. His character was the most entertaining character.Too bad so many people were blinded by DiCaprio's looks and did see the bad acting flowing from him. The special effects were poor. C'mon, long black bars representing the night sky. Mushy looking computer generated faces put over stunt peoples faces to make them look like DiCaprio and Winslet. There is no way that DiCaprio could swim up to the surface of the water after being pulled in by such a huge undertow. The special effects guys forgot to add frozen breath in many of the sequences that take place in the frigid water. Also during that scene you can here soundstage echos. DiCaprio sure spent a lot of time talking about places he had been to, which is fine, considering they did not exsist back then. Oh yea, It was sure nice of DiCaprio to turn his back on his apparent life long best bud for Winslet. What a nice guy. Look closely as Leo enters, the dining hall, you can see the reflection of a big camera and some crew guys carrying it. And if you adjust ticket prices for inflation, Titanic is not even close to being the highest-grossing film of all time. Gone With The Wind, E.T., and even The Star Wars Trilogy would have earned more. Too many Titanic fans brag about that. Kate Winslet did not need to be naked in that film. Also, her older version in the 90's could not have remembered all those facts about the ship. Bill Paxton was wasted in this film.

436,"Even if one missed the proverbial boat when it first launched, and sits to watch this titan very belatedly, it's nonetheless all but impossible to do so without full awareness. The movie holds a place in culture for which there are dashingly few points of comparison: the real-life history, the production history, every last facet of the movie itself, the reactions, awards, jokes, memes, parodies, and so on. Even still, on all accounts - its place in culture, its place in cinema, its accolades and acclaim, and not least on its own merits - there comes a time where it behooves one to watch 'Titanic' for ourselves. Over twenty-six years my expectations have ranged from mixed to high, but I have to say, this really does make a huge impression, right from the start, and proves itself all throughout its substantial length. For all that could be said of this film, and has been in the past two and a half decades, it really is a terrific modern classic, well deserving of its great esteem.There are many flavors throughout these 190 minutes, some coming off better than others. One could remark on how the tale of the RMS Titanic and its fate is romanticized, or how heavy-handed it approaches concurrent themes - all too relevant to real life, contemporary and modern - of classism, deep-seated sexism, and the outright subjugation of women; haughtiness, pride, hubris, jealousy, selfishness, toxic masculinity; the vapidness of wealth and society versus the vitality of the working masses, and more. Some lines and scenes are entirely too on the nose, especially but not exclusively where they concern the ultimate doom of the vessel or those failures and oversights that contributed to the catastrophe; some moments are decidedly ham-handed, embracing kitsch; at some points I'm surprised by how much prominence is given to the present-day framing device. Any scenes that diverge even slightly from either the central romance, or the looming disaster, sometimes feel marginally extraneous, even including the framing and Hockley's abject villainy; at the same time, the swiftness and intensity of Jack and Rose's romance is a bit much at times.And yet for any nits that one may reasonably pick, there's also this: James Cameron penned an absolutely extraordinary screenplay. There's unexpected balance among all the varied parts: the thrills and much needed spark that Jack brings to Rose's life; the love and warmth of the all too brief love affair; joyful humor, shrewd wit, and sheer fun; the cold, hateful antagonism of Rose's fiance and his lackey; the magnitude and gravity of the accident, the protracted sinking, and the excruciatingly tragic loss of life; the reminiscence that frames the core tale. Every beat of the narrative, and every component part that's woven in, is written with wonderful sagacity, and a mind for delicacy, tact, and nuance. Every character and line of dialogue (even those of a less pristine flavor as noted), and more importantly every scene, is written with fantastic intelligence to ensure every moment carries with it the utmost possible vibrancy and impact. Truly, the screenplay is exceptionally smart and well-rounded - and Cameron's direction is at least as grand, shaping every passing minute with an exquisite eye for detail. The result of all this isn't just a historical drama, or a love story - it's a disaster flick, but in contrast with the effects-laden extravaganzas that mostly just revel in destruction, this is one in which we're made to earnestly feel each and every dire moment, and the urgent human cost of such terrible events. For that, 'Titanic' might actually be the best disaster film we've ever been given.But by Jove, this is barely scraping the surface of everything that makes this such a tremendous, enduring picture. There are more familiar, recognizable names and faces in the cast than it even seems at first blush, and while Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio get all the focus, this is to say nothing of Billy Zane, Frances Fisher, Gloria Stuart, Bill Paxton, David Warner, Kathy Bates, Bernard Hill, Eric Braeden, Ioan Gruffudd, and still more. Everyone - sincerely, everyone - gives marvelous performances that very ably capture every mood, from the lightest to the darkest. Nevertheless, the actors may rather be outshone by the utterly outstanding contributions of everyone working behind the scenes. The feature represented a famously enormous production - replicas, models, sets, stunts, and practical effects all as huge as the ship itself - and every last trace simply looks incredible. I dare say the crew are the real stars, for the immensity of every last piece is just plain dazzling; it can't be understated what a magnificent job they all pulled together. I understand that there are some disputes as to the total historical accuracy of the costume design, yet even at that there can be no arguing that Deborah Lynn Scott assembled sartorial arrangements that are to die for; not to be counted out, the hair and makeup is lovely. Russell Carpenter's cinematography is stupendously rich, not to mention amazingly dynamic, crisp, vivid, and smooth, frankly rivaling Cameron's direction in its brilliance. Editing, sound, sound effects; even the post-production CGI is astoundingly keen, to be honest more seamless and realistic than even that of many titles that have followed in the years since. And what can one say of the music except for how perfect it is? Late great composer extraordinaire James Horner remains higher in my esteem than no few of his fellows in the industry, and the score he put together for 'Titanic' is super. Much of it works around the theme song that all know so well, ""My heart will go on,"" to gratifying success, but even setting that aside there are more odds and ends here that have worked their way into the public imagination than I first realized. Horner's music is unquestionably one of the endless highlights of so stellar a movie - and for as much as Celine Dion's rendition of ""My heart will go on"" has become a meme unto itself, it still stands as a beautiful, emotional song that holds definite power.For those various flavors that the writing boasts, some better than others, and for all those ways that the narrative may be stronger or weaker in select times, I quite think these are the only points of criticism of any real significance to be drawn. I'm hard-pressed to think of anything else that sticks out as a flaw, even noting how Cameron's magnum opus takes some liberties with historical record. Moreover, whatever notes one might make of ways in which the whole may be less than perfect: I sat to watch with expectations that ranged from mixed to high, and I'm completely blown away. This is even better than I could have hoped. I'm of the opinion that if this 1997 feature is less than perfect, it's a difference of tiny fractions, and not whole numbers. Part of me is stunned, and part of me is a sobbing mess, but in no part am I inclined to think of 'Titanic' as anything less than a gem - a finely cut diamond, if you will. To some degree I can't believe what I've missed out on for so long, though on the other hand, I don't think I'd have been able to appreciate this twenty-six years ago as much as I do now. When all is said and done I have nothing but praise to offer: this is a heartwarming, heartbreaking, powerful, staggering work of cinema, in every capacity, and it has fully earned all the lofty regard lavished upon it.

437,"What really stands out to me is the high value production that is still very impressive to me twenty-five years after the movie set sail. Great special effects that combine some (admittedly dated) CGI effects with huge sets and dozens of extras that all make the movie a marvel to witness. Truly a movie that deserves to be scene on the big screen and not on television.Unfortunately my main gripe comes with, as many have also pointed out over the years, a bit of a generic social class-based romance plot. A lot of the scenes are nice, and Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet have great chemistry (being both stars' breakout roles), but it really comes down the execution being a bit of a bore and little substance here. I would have liked to see some more light shed on the crew's perspective; the panic realizing that there was nothing to be done and the desperate measures taken to ensure the survival of some of the passengers. Also some more story on the Carpathia finding the life boats and their response to the distress signals. The aftermath of the news breaking out to the rest of the world.

I persevered feeling that I paid good money to see this epic and would see it through to the end. Unlike the assertions of previous comments, I did see the film early on in the piece and wasn't led by the hype. No matter how much they tried there wasn't much chemistry between Leonardo or Kate. (I'm still having some difficulty trying to imagine them as lovers) Needless to say, I didn't get goosebumps looking at Leo and Kate pashing or warm fuzzy feelings when they were finally separated forever.Still, I wasn't totally devoid of feeling.

There was a short line in front of the room where I was to watch the film because people were trying their best to get in on time. I picked a seat up front (even though I prefer to sit a bit farther back), and I got ready to view the film. The lights dimmed and the entire room fell silent. I remember that at the beginning of the film, I was slightly bored. The opening few scenes were different than most movies I had watched back then. But, as the film went on, I grew more and more excited to see what would happen next and I actually became invested deeply into the story. The intense ending with the ship sinking was scary - yet epic! And, when the movie came to a close I was thrilled. I had enjoyed it more than I ever thought I possibly would. I decided to buy it on VHS a few months later, and I played it for my (then teenage) kids. They loved it as well.There was not a single scene in this movie where I thought: maybe this isn't a great film or maybe this was a waste of time.

446,"The film is an action-packed romantic drama set during the maiden voyage of the ""unsinkable"" RMS Titanic. This coming-of-age story centered around 17-year-old Rose DeWitt Bukater, played by Kate Winslet, who is engaged to Cal Hockley, played by Billy Zane, an heir to a steel tycoon, but the marriage was arranged by her mother to maintain their ""high society"" status, after the death of her husband. However, Rose falls in love with a poor artist named Jack Dawson, played by Leonardo DiCaprio.The way Cameron uses of match cuts to tell the story is fantastic. He used this in a scene where the elderly Rose transitions to the young Rose we see on the ship. Another effective transition he used was jump cuts, which helped create a jarring effect, fitting for this tragic story. Additionally, crosscut editing was heavily used, particularly in the scene where Rose was looking for help to free Jack from custody in the master of arms office. The scene flashed back and forth from Jack trying to avoid the rising water to Rose racing up and down the halls looking for help.Cameron excelled in the area of music and sound effects. He used both visible and invisible sounds. Visible sounds, such as the musicians playing in the dining room, helped establish the elegant setting where only high-society people would be dining. However, it was the invisible sounds that were truly incredible. The creaking of the ship as it started to break apart and the clanking of the metal posts as people fell against them when the boat went down added a realistic factor to the movie.James Cameron is a master of creating these types of movies. Take his hit ""Avatar"", for example. Both movies are about two people from opposite worlds who fall in love with each other.

451,"""Titanic"" is a cinematic masterpiece that tells the tragic story of the doomed ocean liner that struck an iceberg and sank on its maiden voyage in 1912. The film, directed by James Cameron, is a tour de force of filmmaking, with stunning visual effects, a heart-wrenching love story, and outstanding performances from its talented cast.The film's lead characters, Jack and Rose, played by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, are the heart of the story, and their chemistry is electric. Their romance, which blossoms against the backdrop of the luxurious ship and its fateful voyage, is both tender and tragic. The performances of both actors are outstanding, and their characters' arcs are masterfully crafted.The film also excels in its technical aspects, with the recreation of the ship and its sinking being a true highlight. The attention to detail in the production design and special effects is astounding, and it makes the audience feel like they are truly on the ship. The film's score, composed by James Horner, is also noteworthy, with its grandiose and emotive melodies adding to the film's overall impact.Overall, ""Titanic"" is a film that stands the test of time, it is a cinematic achievement that is both visually and emotionally stunning. It will leave you on the edge of your seat and with a heavy heart.

453,"It's fair to say that 'Titanic' has forever earned its place in cinematic history. From its gripping, timeless subject matter to its decade-plus run as the highest-grossing film of all time, the James Cameron behemoth as indelibly left a mark on pop culture.Thanks to a gargantuan budget (the only way Cameron knows how to make a movie), the nearly four-hour blockbuster is part love story, part disaster flick. The film is carefully crafted through the narration of centenarian Rose (played beautifully by Gloria Stuart), which breaks up the flow from just a straight shot run through the many times told tale of the ship's doomed maiden voyage across the North Atlantic. But of course, the stars of the show are a young Leo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, as the two rode the wave of the success from this film to accelerate their already bright careers.The reason 'Titanic' works is because it's the perfect mix of drama, romance, action, suspense and history. It's not about telling a new story; it's about telling an old story through new perspectives. The recurring theme of societal status is full on display and harkens back to a timeless struggle. There's also the amazing special effects and CGI, which at the time were world class, and of course James Horner's unforgettable soundtrack (alongside the overplayed power ballad from Celine Dion).'Titanic' has been parodied to death over the years, but it still remains one of the best cinematic stories told in the past few decades.",fair say titan forev earn place cinemat histori grip timeless subject matter decadeplu run highestgross film time jame cameron behemoth indel left mark pop culturethank gargantuan budget way cameron know make movi nearli fourhour blockbust part love stori part disast flick film care craft narrat centenarian rose play beauti gloria stuart break flow straight shot run mani time told tale ship doom maiden voyag across north atlant cours star show young leo dicaprio kate winslet two rode wave success film acceler alreadi bright careersth reason titan work perfect mix drama romanc action suspens histori tell new stori tell old stori new perspect recur theme societ statu full display harken back timeless struggl there also amaz special effect cgi time world class cours jame horner unforgett soundtrack alongsid overplay power ballad celin diontitan parodi death year still remain one best cinemat stori told past decad,positive

461,"The announcement that James Cameron's 1997 blockbuster, Titanic, was to be rereleased to mark the centenary of the ocean liner's disastrous maiden voyage was met with a considerable amount of vitriol from historians and cultural critics.Alongside the somewhat more sober events set to take place on 15 April to commemorate the sinking of the 'unsinkable ship' - including an exhibition in Belfast, where RMS Titanic was built, and a series of seminars in Nova Scotia, close to where it sank - many saw this as Cameron once again cashing in on the tragedy with his fiercely sentimental film. The fact that it has been remastered in 3D has made its release feel all the more in poor taste.I was all of six years old when Titanic first hit our screens. It was, of course, one of the biggest blockbusters of my childhood. So large was its impact, in fact, that on several occasions during my schooling I was subjected to Titanic-themed history and art projects, all of which involved watching the three-and-a-bit-hour behemoth as a primary piece of research. In the years since, it has become the nostalgia movie of choice among my friends. So I've seen it more times than I'd care to count. Seeing it remastered on the big screen, however, made its inadequacy as a historical film more laughably evident than ever.Given the policed divide between the haughty classes of the upper decks and the lowly paupers of steerage, and the shameful priority given to the wealthy when it came to filling the lifeboats, the Titanic tragedy has often been held up as a telling snapshot of the class politics of the time. Through the star-crossed, and completely fictional, love affair between penniless rogue Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) and drippy debutante Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet), Cameron attempts to explore the inherent tensions which the ship contained. This rendering, however, is reductive to say the least: the gilded dining rooms of first class are populated by sarcastic, brandy-swilling poshos and the steerage is full of arm-wrestling Germanics and Guinness-guzzling Irishmen who are prone to punch one another or break into a fiddle recital at the slightest provocation. Probably the most coherent message about class we are given, as the two lovers move between their respective camps, is that it's much more fun to dance a jig below decks than it is to discuss oil prices over caviar.The stories that survived the ship's demise are a mix of startling inhumanity and incredible heroism. But Cameron's manipulative approach often robs his material of its inherent pathos and breeds drastic historical inaccuracies. In its turbulent second half, poignant moments come thick and fast, but many of them are either wholly fictional or shamelessly skewed for the sake of taking some cheap tugs at the heartstrings. The 'unsinkable' Molly Brown, who in the real tragedy insisted the half-full lifeboats return to collect those still stranded in the ice-cold water, is robbed of her triumphant moment and recast as a much less domineering symbol of feminine subordination. Similarly, as is widely known, the ship's string quartet played on top deck as the Titanic went down, in order to calm the passengers, but even this incredible part of the tale is soured by the schmaltz Cameron lays over the scene. As the quartet finish their rendition of 'Orpheus and Eurydice', one of the violinists turns to his fellow musicians and says, 'Gentleman, it has been a privilege playing with you tonight'. Such candy-coated moments continually deaden the impact of the film's rich source material.Cameron once quipped that he only agreed to make the film because a free deep sea dive to the Titanic wreck came as part of the package, suggesting this was never intended to be his magnum opus. Indeed, given the director's famous meticulousness, the film feels like he has been oddly careless in places. Kate Winslet's accent is allowed to wander between American, Irish and English with little consequence, and despite a rigorous casting process for the part of Rose's malevolent fiancé Cal - which saw innumerable famous actors rejected - the appalling Billy Zane was selected, who ends up playing the role like a camp Count Dracula.Despite all this, the clunking one-liners, the dreadful acting and the cheesy artifice actually gives Titanic its distinctive charm. When watching the released film on the big screen, I was surprised to find that most of my fellow audience members were giggling along at all of the abysmal moments, which also had kept me returning to it over the years. For myself and others it seems, this film is more of a trip down 90s memory lane than it is an historically accurate snapshot of a turn-of-the-century tragedy. As such, criticising Titanic on the grounds of historical infidelity is tantamount to damning Top Gun for giving a rose-tinted portrayal of the lives of fighter pilots - doing so would be to miss the point of what makes these films so memorable.I completely agree with those who feel Titanic has no place in the proceedings for the centenary of the original tragedy. Not because Cameron's tacky blockbuster does a disservice to the 1,517 people who lost their lives, but because this film is so inescapably naff that really it shouldn't be taken that seriously.

463,"There is, in the Motion Picture Academy, a hidden criterion for awards. It's called the Miracle Factor.  If a huge, overblown spectacle film production manages to make a killing at the box office and isn't as bad a everyone thought it would be, it acknowledges this miracle with its Best Picture award.  This has happened at least twice:  in 1952, the malign, Red-baiting Cecil B. De Mille, bullied the corrupt, Red-baiting Academy into presenting him with an Oscar for the ridiculous circus spectacle, Greatest Show on Earth; then, in 1997, an equally corrupt, politically correct Academy presented Titanic with its Oscar.Titanic deserved an Oscar in only one category - special effects.  The story was trite, the acting mediocre (except Leo's, which didn't even get nominated), the editing OK (maybe deserving of an Oscar, since great special effects demand great editing).  Titanic's ""beating"" out L.A. Confidential is akin to Greatest Show on Earth's ""beating"" out High Noon.  Standing alone, Titanic is just another disaster spectacle.  But placed beside a film like L.A. Confidential, Titanic becomes pure garbage.This view is no better vindicated than by the Academy's choice for Best Picture the following year, Shakespeare in Love.  If Titanic got the ""Miracle it Wasn't That Bad"" Oscar, then Shakespeare in Love was given the ""Bad Conscience for Titanic"" Oscar.

467,"Titanic is a fair work from director James Cameron. Sometimes being called on the carpet for it's naive plot and dialogue, this movie had the rare merit of reuniting the public and the critics in an unanimous way: James Cameron's Titanic is an effective work to be remembered. This does not happen so often. For several weeks, this movie had the privilege to score brilliantly on the top charts, as well as conquering major movie awards around the world. Is it fair? Was it overrated? That does not matter, if we accept it for what it stands. It worked perfectly. The artwork is ostentatious and the acting if not perfect is adequate and balanced with the strength of the script written by Cameron himself. Leonardo DiCaprio gives the necessary honesty to the role, while Kate Winslet grants the wit, elegance and grace that a romantic and troubled heroin should have. Miss Winslet was without any doubt the finest actress for the role. Apart from the supremacy of the visual effects, which are the main core of this movie for most of its viewers, Titanic dazzles for the truth and sensibility present in every single detail in every scene. More than a parade of mere flash-backs from an old lady who once was ""a dish"", this movie is a fine drama made with a solid sense of loyalty and respect for the viewer. You know what happens before you pay for your ticket. You know it is a love story set on a transatlatic and you know people will die. What matters, most of all, is the possibility Cameron gives you to imagine what might have been if you had the chance to find true love under the most ungrateful circumstances. 8 out of 10 for Cameron's sensibility and courage to write a story without having any previous experience as a screen-writer; 10/10 for a brilliant Kate Winslet, a beautiful and talented British actress who proved that acting skills do not have nationality nor beauty patterns. I had fun watching it. It made me feel like I was sharing the inner conflicts felt by the main characters.

469,"James Cameron does not do small films, even his breakout film The Terminator was hitting way above its budget. This is down to Cameron himself and his extreme work ethic to get the money right up there on the screen. This film often gets poor reviews from people, mainly due to its immense commercial success. However this success is truly deserving. There is no other film maker out there who can produce a film on this kind of scale and still pull it off. I was lucky enough to see it at the cinema in 1997. Straight off to even consider diving to the Titanic wreck itself to film it for the movie would be considered insane, Cameron did it 12 times. The film was pitched as Romeo and Juliet on Titanic and Cameron immediately got funded. The film ran massively over budget and there was huge concern at the time that the whole project would implode. However Cameron knew he was onto something special, creating a stunning replica of the Titanic itself, along with exact decor and furniture, props, clothing, even tableware. Cameron cast Romeo himself from the 1996 film Romeo and Juliet, Leonardo Di Caprio. This was a masterstroke as Di Caprio was gaining unrivalled stardom after the 1996 film. Kate Winslet is fantastic as Rose, as a young actress to have that level of scale all resting on your performance to make it all come to life, she pulled it off amazingly and often does not get the credit she deserves. The real star of the show though is the ship itself and its master film director James Cameron. When the ship starts sinking and Cameron moves into his action mode, there is no-one better in the world at pacing action them Cameron, he is a master of suspense at the exact right moments. He is an exceptional story teller and fully deserved all the accolades he has acquired.

472,"I'll start by saying Titanic was in no means a bad movie but I thought there were way to many flaws in this film to be Oscar worthy... In my opinion Kate Winslet was far from her best when it came to acting in this movie. She said Jack's name ( Leonardo Dicaprio) way to much like everyone watching would forget it or something it was really annoying. I also found later on when there running from that guy who was like Billy Zanes Characters assistant or w.e and after they loose him later on they go back up and he plants the heart of the sea diamond on Jack and the fact Rose believed he stole it after willing to leave her life for him just really bother me because if it was true love she would of trusted her so called love of her life!! That made me real annoyed also. Then when the ship is sinking and she finds out its a lie and goes after him, Rose and Jack go all the way back up from the basement of the ship and find a life boat but they wouldn't let Jack on and he tells her he will find away which he probably would since his character is pretty savvy but instead she jumps back on to the sinking boat, Like what the heck! Now that made me mad...Finally the last thing that no movie has made me feel such anger and disgust was the scene when there in the water and Rose is on that door and poor Jack is in the water shivery his butt off after all he did for her and instead of switching or taking turns she just hogs the whole door till he's dead. She's all sad about his death and talks about how much she loved him but in my opinion she's the reason he died! Overall it wasn't a bad movie and if it wasn't for Kate Winslet's acting in this movie I would also agree it deserved an Oscar. I just think she was a huge flaw to the film and I also think James Cameron could of found a way better actress to play Rose because in my opinion Kate Winslet ruined this movie for me.",ill start say titan mean bad movi thought way mani flaw film oscar worthi opinion kate winslet far best came act movi said jack name leonardo dicaprio way much like everyon watch would forget someth realli annoy also found later run guy like billi zane charact assist loo later go back plant heart sea diamond jack fact rose believ stole will leav life realli bother true love would trust call love life made real annoy also ship sink find lie goe rose jack go way back basement ship find life boat wouldnt let jack tell find away probabl would sinc charact pretti savvi instead jump back sink boat like heck made madfin last thing movi made feel anger disgust scene water rose door poor jack water shiveri butt instead switch take turn hog whole door till he dead she sad death talk much love opinion she reason die overal wasnt bad movi wasnt kate winslet act movi would also agre deserv oscar think huge flaw film also think jame cameron could found way better actress play rose opinion kate winslet ruin movi,neutral

474,"One of the interesting things about this film is that it's pretty clear how Titanic and Avatar are both cut from, essentially, the same cloth despite being two completely different films on paper.As it is widely understood, a lot of time, effort, and money went into making this film possible and it shows. Aside from a couple moments here and there, Titanic is still a fairly impressive looking film to date. Of course, nowadays there is more information about Titanic's interior design with the aid of 20 more years of research behind us and, thus, there are some inaccuracies in this film in that regard, as well as the way the ship sank, but overall, it is clear that they went to painstaking lengths to make this film look as accurate and authentic as possible and I think they succeeded. Of course when you have James Cameron at the helm, usually films end up turning out looking quite impressive so it's no surprise that this film would be any different.However, James Cameron is also one of the reasons why this film falls very short of what it could have been. This has much to do with the quality of writing and its execution. Cal Hockley is little short of a diet James Bond villain and I have no idea what his motivations for pursuing his obviously aloof fiancee aside from serving as an antagonist for Jack. The guy shows no interest in Rose, yet he says he loves her and it seems like the film, at some point, is trying to frame him as being truthful about it- but who knows at this point? On top of that, there's also the same writing trap that this film fall into as Avatar would years later with the very cartoonish poor people good, rich people bad theme which only ages worse when one looks into the real reasons why ships of that time were organized by class.There's also a lot of blatant misrepresentation when it comes to a myriad of issues including the crew of the Titanic and the ship's lifeboat situation-which are all comments made with the aide of hindsight- which makes for a pretty bad representation of history.One of my biggest criticisms of this kind of love story is that usually the female lead is fairly plain and the male lead is where all the personality and likability is. For Titanic, the reverse is true. Rose is extremely likable and has a lot of personality and Kate Winslet is the star of the show, in my opinion. Jack is quite plain on the other hand. I know DiCaprio is a popular actor but I didn't feel as if he really added anything to this role. It just seemed that they hired him to play himself.Despite my criticisms, this is still a pretty well-made film. It has a lot of issues but it is still worth seeing. The love story is predictable but I don't think people watch romance films for their expectations to be subverted anyway. It's far from a bad film, and despite its 3 hour run time it makes excellent use of it. This is probably the date night film to end all date night films until The Notebook came out at the very least that says something.",one interest thing film pretti clear titan avatar cut essenti cloth despit two complet differ film papera wide understood lot time effort money went make film possibl show asid coupl moment titan still fairli impress look film date cours nowaday inform titan interior design aid year research behind u thu inaccuraci film regard well way ship sank overal clear went painstak length make film look accur authent possibl think succeed cours jame cameron helm usual film end turn look quit impress surpris film would differenthowev jame cameron also one reason film fall short could much qualiti write execut cal hockley littl short diet jame bond villain idea motiv pursu obvious aloof fiance asid serv antagonist jack guy show interest rose yet say love seem like film point tri frame truth know point top there also write trap film fall avatar would year later cartoonish poor peopl good rich peopl bad theme age wors one look real reason ship time organ classther also lot blatant misrepresent come myriad issu includ crew titan ship lifeboat situationwhich comment made aid hindsight make pretti bad represent historyon biggest critic kind love stori usual femal lead fairli plain male lead person likabl titan revers true rose extrem likabl lot person kate winslet star show opinion jack quit plain hand know dicaprio popular actor didnt feel realli ad anyth role seem hire play himselfdespit critic still pretti wellmad film lot issu still worth see love stori predict dont think peopl watch romanc film expect subvert anyway far bad film despit hour run time make excel use probabl date night film end date night film notebook came least say someth,neutral

480,"It's funny over the years how your views change on things. This movie came out when I was only 16 years old. I saw it with friends in the theatre more times than I'd ever seen any other movie in theaters. We girls even talked the guys into going along all the time. I heard so many different takes on it as well. My aunt was incensed that James Cameron used a fictional couple instead of focusing on all of the amazing stories there were to tell. I understand why he did though. This way he could tell a story that had the true people in it but he was able to manipulate the main characters. I do know that the most amazing story that my Aunt told us that she thought ought to have been in this movie was that of a third class family. They'd had second class tickets on another ship but that ship's crossing was cancelled, and they were given third class tickets on Titanic. The husband was thrilled because third class on Titanic was supposed to be better than second class on the original ship, but his wife worried constantly. People kept declaring the ship ""unsinkable,"" and that to paraphrase, ""no higher power could sink this ship."" She was a woman who believed that it was a very bad idea to tempt Higher Powers, so every night she sat up on the deck and kept watch so that if something happened she could get her family out first thing. The night Titanic hit the iceberg, she saw it and knew Titanic would go down, so she got her family up and in life belts and on deck. She and her children were some of the few third class passengers to get on lifeboats and survive the sinking because she had her family on deck, ready to go, before they locked down third class.Now back to this actual movie, as a 16 year old I loved the romance between Rose and Jack. My Mother, of course, always had to tell me that it was highly unlikely that a young woman of her breeding and a young man of his background would stay in love for long; that it was more of a shipboard romance. Those romances do occur, of course. As I got older and was in my 20's and 30's, I agreed with my Mother. I still loved watching the movie. I love the clothes and I loved to pretend that the romance could happen, that love could conquer all. Now, watching this movie in my early forties, I can see how Rose and Jack's love could have and actually did last, on her part. She never did let go of him. The thing is that Rose was brought up in the wealthy circle but she viewed the people in it as narrow minded. She saw them all as being the same, especially her mother who was selling her to the highest bidder, no matter how he might actually treat Rose. Inside, before she ever met Jack, she already dreamed of the kind of freedom that Jack's life gave him. She was suffocating in the bounds of a society that had rules to control every part of her existence. When she finally really got to know Jack, when they're talking together the day after she almost committed suicide, she sees a freedom in him that she longs to have. In her Jack sees the spirit to take that freedom and run with it if she just will. He sees more than the proper, docile young lady. He sees in her what no one else does. He sees the rebellious side that matches his own rebellious side. The side they both have to disregard convention. When she goes down to third class with Jack to the party they have down there, she has more fun than she's probably had in her whole, suppressed life. For once she gets to let loose and be a 17 year old young woman. She gets to just have real fun, not suppressed ""fun."" I can again see how the romance between them works and it's obvious that she truly does want that kind of life because instead of finding her mother and Cal on the Carpathia after Jack is dead, she hides out in steerage, gives her name as Rose Dawson, and proceeds to do all of the things she and Jack talked about doing and more. She earns her own way, she rides in the surf side saddle, she learns to fly a plane, she acts, and eventually she even gets married and has children and grandchildren; a family who loved her, just as Jack wanted her to and just as they would have done together if he'd lived. She didn't NEED the money and the high society that her mother was so desperate to cling to. For years I wondered why she didn't give Mr. Lovett the Heart of the Ocean at the end but I think part has to do with the fact that she'd finally gotten all these people who had so little respect for what happened (note Mr. Bodine's comment, ""Oops, someone left the water running,"") to truly SEE and I'm not sure she wanted to undo that but more importantly, the diamond was a burden to her. It was a reminder of a cruel man and a selfish mother. It was a piece of bondage. But she couldn't just get rid of it because it was too well known. People would have begun to realize that Rose had not died on the Titanic. When she finally did throw it overboard right over Titanic, she breathed a huge sigh of relief, like a big burden had just been lifted. I think, even more than my first theory, that's the one that works. She needed to be rid of the burden.The disaster part of it was, of course, exceedingly well done. I admit, after reading several first hand accounts of the sinking, and all of the survivors reported the same thing, they did NOT see Titanic break in two pieces. They simply saw it go down in such a way that it was eventually standing up vertically, before sinking under the water completely. I initially attributed this to the tumult of the night and the trauma they went through. James Cameron and others had come up with the way he showed the ship sink because of how far apart the two sections were on the ocean floor. Now I've seen his 20th anniversary documentary and he does a lot of research into how the Titanic really went down and finally came to the conclusion that it did, in fact, go down in one piece and it broke in two once it was completely under water. My Mom was always surprised that my Dad liked to watch Titanic with her. It turns out that they liked different parts of the movie. She loved the beautiful clothes and the beautiful sets and all of that from the first part of the movie. Dad loved watching the disaster part because it was very well done. He was always sad at the lives that were lost but he separated himself from that reality and watched a well done disaster movie. The one thing that does annoy me is that James Cameron didn't let Molly Brown be the woman she really was. She didn't just sit meekly down in her lifeboat and stay there. After a little while she got back up and threatened to throw the crewman overboard if he didn't go back for survivors. She IS called ""The Unsinkable Molly Brown"" for a reason and not just because of a somewhat fictionalized Debbie Reynolds movie.It is true that the first class men did try to help get the women into boats. I read the book written by Colonel Archibald Gracie right after the sinking. He helped with others to do this. When JJ Astor asked permission to accompany his pregnant wife and was told, ""no,"" He accepted that gracefully and helped get people in the boats as well. Madeline Astor, who may or may not have had more than her fur stole since many didn't dress warmly enough because they didn't believe the ship was sinking, gave her stole to a THIRD class woman (almost unthinkable in those times) so the woman could keep her little boy Filly warm. Madeline was, herself, five months pregnant and probably cold, but she didn't want the little guy to be cold. Colonel Gracie helped get women and children off the ship, then he went and helped cut down the submersibles. They were able to get two boats right side up but not the other two they were working on. As Titanic went farther down, he and several men, held onto the bottom of one of the submersibles that they hadn't been able to get right side up. Many people tried to get on and they allowed as many as they could until the thing began to have trouble staying afloat. Those in the water mostly accepted this and swam away. After waiting for the life boats to come back only Colonel Gracie and Lighttoller were still alive. He died eight months later from complications of hypothermia and diabetes. His last words were, ""Get them in the boats. Get them in the boats.""
Most of us, I think, know about the Strauss's and how Mrs. Strauss declared that she'd been with her husband for fifty years and she wasn't going to leave him now.I suppose part of what I'm trying to get at is that there are so many remarkable stories from the real Titanic that no matter which way James Cameron went, he'd be criticized. If he told some of the stories and not all, the descendants of those left out would've been hurt and angry. He didn't have time to tell ALL of those amazing stories. He only had time to tell some things and the sinking does take up as much as the love story. The Titanic hits the iceberg at about 1 hour 38 minutes out of a 3 hour 15 minute film.I saw another version of Titanic that was made for TV a year before this one came out. They tried to put more of the real passengers in there but it didn't work. They made Colonel Gracie look like a buffoon. The only child, Lorraine, from first class who died, died because her mother couldn't find her baby boy and she wouldn't get on a lifeboat without him. Her baby was already on a boat with his nurse. It was miscommunication. But the movie mixed the nurse up with another woman of the same name who had drowned her own baby. That woman's family were furious. Thing is even if Cameron had tried to just do real stories he'd still be in trouble with family members.Try Julian Fellowes's mini series. It's fascinating, telling the story through all walks of life. I don't know how many of those people were real but some certainly were.Titanic 1997, is a great movie. They needed to show the chaos too because that's why ships have safety drills now. And chaos reigned in the end.",funni year view chang thing movi came year old saw friend theatr time id ever seen movi theater girl even talk guy go along time heard mani differ take well aunt incens

481,"In case you somehow missed the cultural memo, Titanic is part historical disaster, part swoon-worthy romance. It's 1912, and Leonardo DiCaprio (Jack, the poor boy with a heart of gold) and Kate Winslet (Rose, the rich girl with a free spirit) meet aboard the world's most unsinkable ship. Spoiler: it sinks. But not before they fall madly in love, defy class divisions, and draw a certain very memorable sketch. It's a classic opposites-attract romance with a big ol' iceberg to ruin everything.James Cameron takes his sweet time setting up the first half as we bask in all the luxury of the ship, but once that iceberg hits... it's chaos. It's a story we all know, but the blend of fictional romance with real historical tragedy is surprisingly gripping, even though you know where it's headed (straight to the bottom of the Atlantic).Let's get this out of the way: Leo and Kate? Iconic. Their chemistry is what really keeps this ship afloat (pun intended). Leo's Jack is charming, carefree, and the kind of guy you'd totally risk your first-class ticket for. Kate's Rose is the perfect balance of elegance and rebellion, refusing to be caged by society's expectations-or, y'know, Billy Zane's wildly over-the-top villain energy as her fiancé, Cal.The supporting cast is also solid, from Kathy Bates as the unsinkable Molly Brown to that one guy who yells ""Iceberg, right ahead!"" It's an ensemble that knows how to bring the drama, even if it's really Jack and Rose who steal the show-and our hearts.Even by today's standards, the visuals in Titanic are stunning. Cameron didn't just recreate the ship-he built a freaking floating palace. The sweeping shots of the ocean liner cruising through the water? Gorgeous. The detailed interiors? Luxe. And that sinking sequence? Absolute chaos.When the iceberg does its thing, the movie shifts gears into full disaster mode, and it's intense. People sliding down the deck, water bursting through the corridors-it's a disaster movie done right. And the mix of practical effects and CGI is (mostly) seamless, giving us a sinking that feels tragically real. If you weren't scared of the ocean before, you probably are now.Can we talk about the My Heart Will Go On effect? Celine Dion's voice literally became the anthem of the late 90s. You could not escape this song. It played at weddings, school dances, in grocery stores, and probably in your sleep. And yes, it's cheesy and over-the-top, but it's also iconic, and it somehow works.James Horner's score is equal parts haunting and heart-wrenching, building the tension as the ship goes down and making you cry on cue. By the time Celine belts out that final note, you're either tearing up or aggressively pretending not to be. Either way, that song is burned into your memory forever.So Titanic is basically a love letter to doomed romance, right? It's about fleeting moments of joy, standing up to the system, and, of course, icy water ruining everything. But it also dives (heh) into class struggles, survival, and the fragility of life-because nothing says ""life is short"" like an iceberg taking out the world's fanciest boat.But seriously, while Jack and Rose's love story is the emotional core, the film's depiction of the chaos, desperation, and human drama during the sinking is what makes it more than just a romance.

485,"A lot of people like Titanic. Seeing it won 11 Oscar's and grossed over 1 billion dollars. I really did not care for this movie. It is long, boring and takes around 2 and a half hours for it to get good.Titanic is an ""ok"" movie. Leo does a good job like he always does, portraying a poor man who falls in love with a rich girl. Kate Winslet in my opinion, was a bad choice. She tries her best to act rich and proper but fails in general. Near the end she improves her acting but still is very stale. Billy Zane in my opinion really shines out of the two leads. He does a good job portraying someone who is very sophisticated, but also shines in all the other parts, when he is jealous of Leo and Kate's characters.What did I have wrong with the movie? It is so long. 3 hours and 14 minutes! It takes 2 1/2 hours for it to get to the iceberg alone. The first 30 minutes of the film, is Bill Paxton and his crew trying to find the blue diamond (whatever it's called). Then the next 2 hours, are back and forth between Leo and Kate. While watching the film, I found myself tapping my foot in boredom and wondering when is it gonna get good. I really could have cared less for the first 2 1/2 hours. Sure, there are a few good scenes here at there, but it takes so long for it to get to the good sequences.Even thought this picture is long, I should give credit where credit is due. The visuals are stunning. After watching this more then 10 years later, I still can't tell that the ship and the scene where it breaks it in half to be fake, where I can when I watch things like The Matrix and Toy Story.Also, the last hour of the film is really good. I really have nothing to complain about. Cameron did a good job. The ending is emotional but a little stupid. He could have fit on top of the wood, he did not really have to die.Anyway, Titanic is long, boring but gets good near the end. 6/10",lot peopl like titan see oscar gross billion dollar realli care movi long bore take around half hour get goodtitan ok movi leo good job like alway portray poor man fall love rich girl kate winslet opinion bad choic tri best act rich proper fail gener near end improv act still stale billi zane opinion realli shine two lead good job portray someon sophist also shine part jealou leo kate characterswhat wrong movi long hour minut take hour get iceberg alon first minut film bill paxton crew tri find blue diamond whatev call next hour back forth leo kate watch film found tap foot boredom wonder gon na get good realli could care le first hour sure good scene take long get good sequenceseven thought pictur long give credit credit due visual stun watch year later still cant tell ship scene break half fake watch thing like matrix toy storyalso last hour film realli good realli noth complain cameron good job end emot littl stupid could fit top wood realli dieanyway titan long bore get good near end,positive

488,"First; let me say that the recreation of the RMS Titanic as a computer- generated entity is extremely well realised. If ever we needed proof that CGI can add an extra dimension to established technique and 'effects' when it's done with meticulous precision - here it is.But what about story? The Titanic contained over 1,500 human stories. Most of them were to end in terror on that fatal, freezing night.However, Mr Cameron decided that non of these were worth spit. They would serve simply as a desperate backdrop for two imaginary characters who might just as easily have been computer-generated themselves, so artificial, clichéd and crass were their presentation.Star-crossed young lovers projected against conflicting circumstances of the larger world have been a staple in human drama for as long as we have kept records. Perhaps the most famous example is Shakespeare's 'Romeo & Juliet'.What have we got here? Disaffected society girl meets, and finds redemption, in gallant working-class hero. Pass me the vomitarium, someone. She already has a beau; and he's as knavish as can be. In an early silent movie you can see him with a big bristly moustache and cruel leer, tying his victim to a railroad track. He's not going to be put down by a working-class oik. He'll resort to murder, if needs be. Cameron turns this Mack Sennett cliché on its head by casting the heroine as saviour. We see her wading waist-deep in the icy Atlantic waters without flinching from the cold (just you try it!), in earnest search for her manacled hero. Love isn't just blind - it's numb.But - hey; wait a minute! this is a romantic story from the old school. We can't let emancipation stand in the way of a damp hankie. The hero's got to do what a hero's got to do. Isn't that what males are bred for, after all? I mean; equality in pay is one thing, but equality in death? I don't think so. Oh-no; the male is always the more expendable. So, in the end we see him slowly freezing to death in the ocean whilst the heroine survives on a piece of flotsam. His duty done, his grip is relinquished, and he slips down to eternity. Whilst she gets to live another day and find a more durable schmuck. You can see that same scenario at the end of equally laughable 'Starship Troopers 2'. Yep; the hat's that old.And she might have to move pretty damn quick too. That passionate little dalliance in the coach could well have put a bun in the oven. It wouldn't do to have a child out of wedlock in 1912.Romance in the face of disaster became quite a fashion at this time, with other movies like 'Pearl Habour' playing much the same card. As I say; young romantic tragedy is a long-standing cultural staple in human story-telling. It just isn't usually so extremely crass and predictable as 'Titanic'.Tissues out or vomitarium at the ready, depending upon your gullibility quotient.",first let say recreat rm titan comput gener entiti extrem well realis ever need proof cgi add extra dimens establish techniqu effect done meticul precis isbut stori titan contain human stori end terror fatal freez nighthowev mr cameron decid non worth spit would serv simpli desper backdrop two imaginari charact might easili computergener artifici clichd crass presentationstarcross young lover project conflict circumst larger world stapl human drama long kept record perhap famou exampl shakespear romeo julietwhat got disaffect societi girl meet find redempt gallant workingclass hero pas vomitarium someon alreadi beau he knavish earli silent movi see big bristli moustach cruel leer tie victim railroad track he go put workingclass oik hell resort murder need cameron turn mack sennett clich head cast heroin saviour see wade waistdeep ici atlant water without flinch cold tri earnest search manacl hero love isnt blind numbbut hey wait minut romant stori old school cant let emancip stand way damp hanki hero got hero got isnt male bred mean equal pay one thing equal death dont think ohno male alway expend end see slowli freez death ocean whilst heroin surviv piec flotsam duti done grip relinquish slip etern whilst get live anoth day find durabl schmuck see scenario end equal laughabl starship trooper yep hat oldand might move pretti damn quick passion littl dallianc coach could well put bun oven wouldnt child wedlock romanc face disast becam quit fashion time movi like pearl habour play much card say young romant tragedi longstand cultur stapl human storytel isnt usual extrem crass predict titanictissu vomitarium readi depend upon gullibl quotient,neutral
489,"It makes me question the legitimacy of modern-day film criticism when I see films like this constantly getting thrown under the bus for a supposed ""lack of substance"". The discussion surrounding the medium as a whole has been spat on for years due to the ludicrous mentality that big budget blockbusters somehow have less validity than arthouse cinema or anything else outside of the usual wide release theater-fare. All genres deserve to stand shoulder to shoulder with one another, as they're all pieces of art and should be appreciated as such.James Cameron's 'Titanic' released in 1997 and became an instant classic, though a somewhat controversial one. It shattered every record imaginable and won countless awards for its bold style, immaculate set design, and groundbreaking everything. It was huge, and the film itself compliments that sentiment. The biggest boat in the world, the greatest love story ever told, and the most tragic disaster of the century. The sheer scale and spectacle of this film is incredible. It was massive, and even with an industry now focused on world ending events and apocalypses of all shapes and sizes, it still remains massive today.'Titanic' follows Rose, a seventeen-year-old aristocrat who, despite her luxurious life, is unsatisfied and longs for something more. She meets and subsequently falls in love with Jack, a poor artist who won his ticket in a game of poker. A very basic setup, right? One that we've all seen a thousand times before. The difference is, this is the one that everyone remembers. This is what separates this love story from other love stories: It's memorable. Clichés aren't bad, I honestly believe that they're essential to storytelling. It's what you do with them that matters. James Cameron takes a somewhat basic love story about two people from different worlds falling in love with each other despite their differences and puts it inside a disaster of monumental scale. We all know that the unsinkable ship will inevitably sink, but its everything before that - the characters - the buildup - the overconfidence that all the passengers and crew uphold - it plants the idea in your head that maybe, just maybe, it'll be different this time. The events that transpire before the sinking is what makes it all the more impactful. If it was just a random ship filled with people you don't care about, it wouldn't affect you. Instead, it's a real world tragedy with characters that you've spent hours watching grow and evolve.Themes of perseverance, freedom, and love are represented beautifully here. Images like the violinists trying to maintain a sense of duty and composure amidst the chaos will forever be ingrained in my head. My Heart Will Go On by Céline Dion is not only a beautiful piece of music, but it connects to what I think is, the central theme of the film. Remembrance. Push forward, but never forget. Rose promises Jack to survive and live her life, but she'll always remember her short, but magical time on the ship all those years ago.Despite the groundbreaking nature of 'Titanic', that's not what first comes to mind when talking about this film. It's the characters, the journey, and the story that's captured the hearts of many moviegoers and film fans alike. That's what was discussed when it released, that's what we discuss now, and that's what will be discussed for generations to follow.",make question legitimaci modernday film critic see film like constantli get thrown bu suppos lack substanc discus surround medium whole spat year due ludicr mental big budget blockbust somehow le valid arthous cinema anyth el outsid usual wide releas theaterfar genr deserv stand shoulder shoulder one anoth theyr piec art appreci suchjam cameron titan releas becam instant classic though somewhat controversi one shatter everi record imagin countless award bold style immacul set design groundbreak everyth huge film compliment sentiment biggest boat world greatest love stori ever told tragic disast centuri sheer scale spectacl film incred massiv even industri focus world end event apocalyps shape size still remain massiv todaytitan follow rose seventeenyearold aristocrat despit luxuri life unsatisfi long someth meet subsequ fall love jack poor artist ticket game poker basic setup right one weve seen thousand time differ one everyon rememb separ love stori love stori memor clich arent bad honestli believ theyr essenti storytel matter jame cameron take somewhat basic love stori two peopl differ world fall love despit differ put insid disast monument scale know unsink ship inevit sink everyth charact buildup overconfid passeng crew uphold plant idea head mayb mayb itll differ time event transpir sink make impact random ship fill peopl dont care wouldnt affect instead real world tragedi charact youv spent hour watch grow evolvethem persever freedom love repres beauti imag like violinist tri maintain sen duti composur amidst chao forev ingrain head heart go cline dion beauti piec music connect think central theme film remembr push forward never forget rose promis jack surviv live life shell alway rememb short magic time ship year agodespit groundbreak natur titan that first come mind talk film charact journey stori that captur heart mani moviego film fan alik that discus releas that discus that discus gener follow,positive
490,"According to the press, Cameron got the idea for the picture after watching a documentary by James Ballard from the National Geographic series, filmed in 1987 and telling about a trip to a liner resting on the ocean floor. However, before the realization of the idea, the eminent director-screenwriter created not only the ""Abyss"", where the action takes place under water, but also the expensive futuristic action movie ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"", only after that he managed to convince the management of two majors, 20th Century Fox and Paramount Pictures, to agree to mind-blowing costs (eventually the budget was a record $ 200 million), which predicted a grand catastrophe in advance. But Cameron still did not back down and, moreover, remained faithful to the initially chosen course: that is why the main action is framed in ""Titanic"" by a prologue and an epilogue telling about a group of researchers trying to find out at least some details of the crash. However, the secret of the phenomenal success of the film without exaggeration around the world (the total box office totaled over $ 1.8 billion, of which only $ 600 million was in North America) lies in something else. Unlike the creators of almost all previous versions, Cameron outlined the story taking into account the rather strict requirements of what is commonly called - certainly with capital letters! - Big Hollywood Style. His brainchild can be considered a contribution of overseas cinematographers of the end of the XX century to that glorious tradition, with which, first of all, the products of the ""factory of stars"" were associated in the minds of the mass audience throughout the century. ""Titanic"" fits perfectly into the typological series, including such names as ""The Birth of a Nation"", ""Ben Hur"" (even two versions, the 20s and 50s), ""Gone with the Wind"", ""Doctor Zhivago"", ""The Sound of Music"". On the one hand, the story is again based on a genuine event - and a significant, even fateful event. The author not only reproduces the circumstances of the tragedy in the most detailed way, but interprets it in a symbolic way as an ominous warning to humanity - a warning about those global cataclysms of a political, social, man-made and natural nature that soon hit the Earth. The dramatically increased possibilities of cinema allowed the audience to assess the true scale of what happened, to feel to the depths of the soul and clearly see what the iron tread of History is. However, on the other hand, making a reservation just in case, the director-screenwriter introduces a fictional character (Cameron insisted on the candidacy of DiCaprio, then little-known), who turns out to be the main character of the entire romantic line, where fantasy, again according to custom, is not at all obliged to obey the facts. ""Titanic"", therefore, does not seem to be an innovative work, which, perhaps, it did not pretend to be. But Cameron cannot but be grateful for the contribution that he has made to the growth of the popularity of cinema all over the planet.",accord press cameron got idea pictur watch documentari jame ballard nation geograph seri film tell trip liner rest ocean floor howev realiz idea emin directorscreenwrit creat abyss action take place water also expens futurist action movi termin judgment day manag convinc manag two major th centuri fox paramount pictur agre mindblow cost eventu budget record million predict grand catastroph advanc cameron still back moreov remain faith initi chosen cours main action frame titan prologu epilogu tell group research tri find least detail crash howev secret phenomen success film without exagger around world total box offic total billion million north america lie someth el unlik creator almost previou version cameron outlin stori take account rather strict requir commonli call certainli capit letter big hollywood style brainchild consid contribut oversea cinematograph end xx centuri gloriou tradit first product factori star associ mind mass audienc throughout centuri titan fit perfectli typolog seri includ name birth nation ben hur even two version gone wind doctor zhivago sound music one hand stori base genuin event signific even fate event author reproduc circumst tragedi detail way interpret symbol way omin warn human warn global cataclysm polit social manmad natur natur soon hit earth dramat increas possibl cinema allow audienc ass true scale happen feel depth soul clearli see iron tread histori howev hand make reserv case directorscreenwrit introduc fiction charact cameron insist candidaci dicaprio littleknown turn main charact entir romant line fantasi accord custom oblig obey fact titan therefor seem innov work perhap pretend cameron grate contribut made growth popular cinema planet,neutral

494,"Thats the question that DiCapitated-lovelorn girls ask themselves when someone like me tells 'em that this movie really truly sucks. I went with my girlfriend (she is not a DiCaprio-lovelorn girl, she actually thinks he's gay) to the theatre to see this movie. I thought it would be a good movie to watch with her, since its basically a chick flick, and she would be happy after the movie, and really happy with me for wanting to go with her, I just wanted to make her happy. But those three hours in that theatre seemed to go longer than any In School Suspension that I have ever served in school. And believe you me, ISS is the most boringest part of school. I mean, at least in class you got your friends and chicks to check out, but ISS is like a prison. But anyway, before I get completely off the subject, Titanic is way way way stretched out. 3 HOURS! 3 HOURS is what they make you wait to see the ship sink. And thats it! In between those 3 HOURS all there is is two people that fall in love, one being a poor boy, and the other, a rich, easy girl. I mean, they just met, and she already took of her clothes and even had sex with the guy, aint that an easy girl?! So, all that happens is the movie wastes 3 HOURS of our lives, which I couldve used in other things, and show us a really cool sequence of how the ship looks and how it sank.

495,"Titanic is a feature film of American production from 1997, this romantic tragedy is based on a historical event - the sinking of the ""Titanic"" in 1912. It was directed from his own script by James Cameron.This romantic tragedy is set against the backdrop of the most famous shipwreck in history. The well-directed movie of James Cameron presents us with the story of Jack Dawson, who won a cruise ticket in poker. Rose, a beautiful aristocratic girl, is also heading to the ship. Her mother wants to marry her off to Cal Hockley, but when Rose meets Jack, she already knows who her love is. Unfortunately, the lovers will be separated by an iceberg, through which the titular ship will sink. We can owe all the charm of this wonderful story to equally wonderful actors - Leonardo DiCaprio and Oscar nominated Kate Winslet.I think the screenplay is sometimes funny but mostly it is very sad and it keeps the audience in suspense. The soundtrack is terrifying and very sad but it is often merry and mysterious. There are exciting special effects. The main actors are perfectly suited to their roles.To sum up, ""Titanic"" is for everyone who likes love stories or disaster movies.

Populating said story with other characters, appropriate suits, music, suspense and so on. If that is not the concept that soap operas take to unbearable lengths, don't know what it is.The movie does not shed much light over the social classes or condition at the time (can do that, but it is somehow marginal), does not depict very deep characters (they may be, but they do not waste time self analysing), and the story is focused on one thing - to be compelling, and appropriately match the huge ship and its story. That is all. It does not even mirror the Titanic story, it just uses it as a background. And it keeps one glued to the screen by taking all they could and investing it into the characters and details, with the force specific to British productions, frankly, when you have to take them seriously just because they take themselves so seriously.The rest is just glorifying the mass effect, turning a human drama (or tragedy) -movie into a legend.

498,"Surely millions of people worldwide, a billion dollars and 11 Oscars can't be wrong can they? Well yes, actually.The problem with Titanic is that Cameron treats the whole enterprise like one of his action pictures, replete with the kind of staging you'd expect from that genre, but not alas, from a dramatisation of a genuine tragedy. Cameron has no faith in the emotional weight of the historical facts, and if we were being cynical we could also say no interest. This is an exercise in ego and directorial hubris from the outset, namely the idea that the writers fictional teenage romance - a story that never succeeds in rising above its clichéd origins, is required to connect a contemporary audience to the events of 1912. You can see the logic because clearly the world's worst peacetime maritime tragedy, 1,500 dead and the planets most luxurious ocean liner sinking on its maiden voyage isn't an interesting enough story in itself. Subsequently the titular ship becomes merely a backdrop for a populist voyage into tedium. Just as you'd feel uneasy at the prospect of Michael Bay doing Jane Austen, Cameron doing period romance seems a little far fetched. Jack and Rose allow us to spend some time on the ship prior to its sinking and an impressive recreation it is but you'd quite like them to go away so we could see what the real passengers were up to. That he sustains momentum throughout this picture is despite his script, rather than because of it. His talent for pacing and moving a story forward serves him well in this respect but with fictional characters as one note as these, and with the ships real passengers reduced to supporting parts to bolster Cameron's mills and boon narrative, we, unlike the real passengers are quite grateful to see the Iceberg emerging from the watery depths.Once the ship hits the film moves up a gear and suddenly there is enough to sustain interest until the stilted syrup drenched epilogue. However, Cameron still stages the sinking like one giant set piece which saps the film of any emotional impact. A real tribute to the ship, rather than a cynical exercise in emotional manipulation would have taken an objective position and allowed the real events to unfold, giving us a chance to take in the full force of real events. This film concerns itself with fiction and doing so attempts to tell you what to feel and when to feel it. For me, this has the opposite effect and the scenes toward the end featuring Winslet and Decaprio are virtually unwatchable.The production design is superb and its all very epic and grandiose but ultimately Titanic is a disappointment because it takes a real tragedy and turns it into populist entertainment. History for people not interested in History. If you think thats a harsh assessment then imagine a similar scenario applied to a retelling of the September 11th attacks and think how inappropriate that would seem. These people may be 90 odd years dead but they deserve more respectful treatment than this. Watch ""A night to remember"" (1958) for a far better depiction of events which was informed by accounts of the sinking not by one man who thought he had something to 'add' to this terrible event.

501,"I just got out of The BatmanThis movie really won't be for everyone!! Easily the darkest Batman movie yet. It is gritty, depressing and not a fun movie at all.This isn't your usual comic book movie, it's a detective movie, with more in common with Se7en, than previous Batman movies. The first two thirds of the movie are amazing, at one point I turned to my son and said ""This is a masterpiece"" everything works and is brilliant, I was 100% enthralled, but boy does it drop the ball in the final act.Of the cast Pattinson is great, Collin Farrell is ok, Zoe Kravitz was fine too, but she has zero chemistry with Pattinson (Keaton and Pfeiffer they are not), Paul Dano though, was incredible, especially in the scene in Arkham, whilst Geoffrey Wright is as great as he always is.On the downside, It does have some pacing issues, and is really too long (though I'm not sure what I'd cut), and I really wasn't keen on the ending (I don't know if it is a comic book storyline they did), as I think the final act really lets the movie down!!

502,"A serial killer strikes in Gotham City, killing important political figures, and leaving behind a series of cryptic clues, only Batman can stop him.It's certainly very different to all previous Batman films, it's definitely dark and atmospheric, but the pitch and narrative are very different. The Batman is told almost as a crime noir, made in a way that you could watch it in black and white to enjoy a different perspective.Interesting in that it's a real exploration of the character, his past and family, we get a sense as to why this Batman is so haunted.I wasn't blown away when I heard that Robert Pattinson was cast as Batman, Vengeance, but I was won over very quickly by him, clearly penned as a character with the weight of the world on his shoulders, this incarnation is dark, haunted, relentless, but strong and determined. Don't expect laughs or lighter moments, there aren't any.Andy Serkis awesome as always, I thought Colin Farrell and Paul Dano were great too.Great visuals throughout, Gotham looks terrific, and there are some terrific special effects, and a few duff ones too. I think Pattinson looked awesome in the costume, it was well designed.The music was fantastic I thought, one of the movie's best elements, interesting seeing so much carnage played out to Ave Maria, a real juxtaposition.I wish I could say it was without any flaws, as it is an epic, imaginative reimagining, one that deserved its success, however pacing is an issue, it feels long for the sake of being long at times, some scenes are painfully drawn out. Some of the dialogue was hard to make our at times too, was it me, or was some of it a little muffled?What I really didn't like though, the ending, that has to knock a couple of stars of the rating, it just didn't work.Interesting to see what comes next, this was an imaginative retelling.7/10.",serial killer strike gotham citi kill import polit figur leav behind seri cryptic clue batman stop himit certainli differ previou batman film definit dark atmospher pitch narr differ batman told almost crime noir made way could watch black white enjoy differ perspectiveinterest real explor charact past famili get sen batman hauntedi wasnt blown away heard robert pattinson cast batman vengeanc quickli clearli pen charact weight world shoulder incarn dark haunt relentless strong determin dont expect laugh lighter moment arent anyandi serki awesom alway thought colin farrel paul dano great toogreat visual throughout gotham look terrif terrif special effect duff one think pattinson look awesom costum well designedth music fantast thought one movi best element interest see much carnag play ave maria real juxtapositioni wish could say without flaw epic imagin reimagin one deserv success howev pace issu feel long sake long time scene pain drawn dialogu hard make time littl muffledwhat realli didnt like though end knock coupl star rate didnt workinterest see come next imagin retel,positive

504,"I have been absolutely fizzing to see 'The Batman' from the day it was announced, but even more so from when I first heard it described as being inspired by 'Se7en' - one of my favourite psychological thrillers of all time. Were we finally going to get the raw and gritty Batman film I'd always dreamed of seeing? We certainly were.Where to begin? The biggest thing that struck me with this film was just how much time we got to spend with Batman, as Batman. There is very little of Bruce Wayne in this movie and I'm absolutely fine with that. The movie is Batman's story and we are with him from start to finish. We even get some narration from him, which I'm not quite sure how I feel about just yet. It was very good narration but I'm not sure he's a character I want it from.The Riddler in this movie is phenomenal. After The Joker in 'The Dark Knight' this is absolutely my second favourite Batman film villain. He was clearly inspired by the Zodiac killer and what an inspired choice. Also the use of the riddles in the film is nothing short of genius. These are very clever riddles and puzzles and make Batman have to do some serious detective work - something I've always wanted more of from him in the previous films.This is my favourite incarnation of Catwoman to date. I haven't loved her character's place in the films in the past. I've found she slows everything down and brings out a dull side of Batman that I haven't enjoyed. In this film though she was used perfectly. She's the love interest and a villain/anti-hero all in one. That is massive because it saves another thing that can often bog down a Batman film - the pointless love interest.The Penguin was probably the one letdown for me. From what I'd seen in the trailer I suspected this may be the case. I'm wondering if they were using this movie as a set-up for him and then in the second film he will evolve and have a lot more to do. In this one though I just found him quite a dull screen-presence.Robert Pattinson as Batman blew me away. He looked great and his voice was perfect. He was extremely intense and very menacing. Even though I knew he was more than capable of playing the role, I think I still needed to see the end product just for confirmation that he had what it takes. He absolutely did and then some.The film has quite a unique feel. There are scenes and sequences in this film that would feel out of place in both Tim Burton's Batman universe and Christopher Nolan's universe. But then there are little aspects from each of their respective films which clearly inspired parts of 'The Batman'. It basically took the best things from each of them and then twisted them into it's own style - while obviously adding a lot of its own stuff also. It's very well done in that sense.The Batmobile in this movie is awesome. There's just no other way to put it. The sound it made and the vibrations it sent through my cinema chair were bone-chilling. The chase sequence in this movie with The Penguin is one of the best I've ever seen.The film is long at just under 3 hours but it really never feels like it. There's a short period in the middle of the movie where everything slows down for a little while. That really is the only flat part of the movie however. The rest happens at a break-neck pace.It's hard to find enough good things to say about this movie. I need to see it again and digest a couple of things for a little longer, but for now I have it firmly sitting in second place behind 'The Dark Knight' in my order of favourite Batman films. 10/10.",absolut fizz see batman day announc even first heard describ inspir seen one favourit psycholog thriller time final go get raw gritti batman film id alway dream see certainli werewher begin biggest thing struck film much time got spend batman batman littl bruce wayn movi im absolut fine movi batman stori start finish even get narrat im quit sure feel yet good narrat im sure he charact want fromth riddler movi phenomen joker dark knight absolut second favourit batman film villain clearli inspir zodiac killer inspir choic also use riddl film noth short geniu clever riddl puzzl make batman seriou detect work someth ive alway want previou filmsthi favourit incarn catwoman date havent love charact place film past ive found slow everyth bring dull side batman havent enjoy film though use perfectli she love interest villainantihero one massiv save anoth thing often bog batman film pointless love interestth penguin probabl one letdown id seen trailer suspect may case im wonder use movi setup second film evolv lot one though found quit dull screenpresencerobert pattinson batman blew away look great voic perfect extrem intens menac even though knew capabl play role think still need see end product confirm take absolut someth film quit uniqu feel scene sequenc film would feel place tim burton batman univers christoph nolan univers littl aspect respect film clearli inspir part batman basic took best thing twist style obvious ad lot stuff also well done senseth batmobil movi awesom there way put sound made vibrat sent cinema chair bonechil chase sequenc movi penguin one best ive ever seenth film long hour realli never feel like there short period middl movi everyth slow littl realli flat part movi howev rest happen breakneck paceit hard find enough good thing say movi need see digest coupl thing littl longer firmli sit second place behind dark knight order favourit batman film,positive
505,"The Riddler(Paul Dano, spot-on. How did it take this long for him to get a role like this?) targets public officials, revealing their corruption, and killing them in gruesome fashion(how did this get away with a PG-13 again? Oh, right, as long as you don't show the details, then you can get away with almost anything, by now. Even a barely toned down Jigsaw). In order to stop him, it will be necessary for the Bat and the Cat(with amazing chemistry), together, to stop the rat. Thanks, Matt.I really did not think that we needed yet another film dealing with Bruce Wayne's alter-ego. How about Nightwing? I know it's not likely, but part of me still holds out hope that Grayson will be turned into a feature(if you've never checked out the trailer on YouTube, you're missing out). But somehow, this managed to convince me. Fingers crossed for at least one sequel. Robert Pattinson is incredible here. Seriously, can we just stop freaking out every time the role is recast? The closest we've come to someone who shouldn't be doing it is George Clooney, and it's not like anybody came out of that flick looking good. He took that job after doing From Dusk till Dawn. There was good reason to think that he was going to be badass. Honestly, everyone here gives a strong performance.Something that will definitely appeal to some more than others, is the genre and tone. This is essentially Se7en meets Zodiac. It is not paced like a typical massive blockbuster. While the action is great, especially the martial arts, not to mention that car chase, there's less of it and it is smaller scale than for example the Nolan trilogy(which also has far more escalation). Essentially, this just isn't focused that much on that aspect of the titular icon. And I think we can all agree that we've had some great entries that deliver that. This is more interested in conveying to the audience that there's a reason he's called the world's greatest detective. We've barely seen it outside of the animated ones before, so I'm very happy with that choice by them.In addition to what I've already mentioned, this features some drugs, suggestive material and strong language.

506,"Approaching this review holistically as my favorite Batman is Kevin Conroy (sorry live action movies) - my credentials - an average fan, have read most of the Detective and Batman comics, watched most the DC animated shows and movies as well as live action films and played all the Arkham games and also the Telltale series.To avoid spoilers, just commenting on the actual acting more than plot.I didn't like the Batman voice but midway through it grew on me. Acting wise Mr Pattinson is impressive (but my favorite roles of his are as Neil, Cedric Diggory and Rev. Teagardin) - as Batman, remember this is Bats in year 2 and Mr Pattinson nails it as well. A fine actor (not better than Mr Keaton but that is childhood nostalgia maybe however just as batty as Mr Bale..Mr Affleck was awesome as well but scripting for him was below par).Ms Kravitz was maybe born to play Selina (at least this gritty version). I honestly disliked Ms Kravitz in X-Men and Grindlewald but liked her in Big Little Lies. I was skeptical given her lack of martial arts but it is evident she gave her best during training and for me, her portrayal of Selina was perfect. Chemistry wise though, needed some work between Bats and Cats but nothing worth losing a star over.Mr Dano, wow; Saw like sadist perhaps inspired by Mr Spacey a bit, a Riddler far from the kooky ""riddle me this"" we have come to know and enjoy but he gave in a performance no less than his stellar efforts with Daniel Day Lewis. I have become a fan of Mr Dano's acting.Mr Serkis, just when I thought a re-imagining might go awry, there is Mr Serkis. He portrays Alfred so naturally, it's as if he is Alfred Pennyworth.Mr Wright is a fair enough Gordon and without any fault of his, once you've seen him as Felix Leiter (as he was the best Leiter for me) it's hard to not compare his take on Gordon with Leiter. Also once you've seen Mr Oldman in and as anything...well Mr Oldman is my best Gordon (like Mr Simmons is my best JJJameson).Mr Farrell was a believable budding Cobblepot and I hope he brings the same effort to the supposed spinoff (suffice to say I also had enjoyed his take on Bullseye..but InBruges is till my best for Mr Farrell).Mr Turturro is limited but still impactful as was Mr Skarsgard.Direction/Plot - I appreciate good work and Mr Reeves clearly put in an honest effort. I enjoyed his vision and never felt bored or distracted whilst watching his movie. He is not Mr Nolan or Mr Burton or Mr Timm/Mr Dini, but a league of his own and in this, he owned it. Thank you for not messing it up.Story wise the movie is entertaining and well made - there is a threat, hero and allies must work to show their relevance and save the day - done quite effectively (not life changing but films rarely are, however storytelling is meaningful). Obviously production values are impressive and the cinematography is amazing. Set designs are useful while costumes are well thought out and used relevantly.Overall - 10 out of 10 from me.Vinaka from Fiji.",approach review holist favorit batman kevin conroy sorri live action movi credenti averag fan read detect batman comic watch dc anim show movi well live action film play arkham game also telltal seriesto avoid spoiler comment actual act ploti didnt like batman voic midway grew act wise mr pattinson impress favorit role neil cedric diggori rev teagardin batman rememb bat year mr pattinson nail well fine actor better mr keaton childhood nostalgia mayb howev batti mr balemr affleck awesom well script parm kravitz mayb born play selina least gritti version honestli dislik m kravitz xmen grindlewald like big littl lie skeptic given lack martial art evid gave best train portray selina perfect chemistri wise though need work bat cat noth worth lose star overmr dano wow saw like sadist perhap inspir mr spacey bit riddler far kooki riddl come know enjoy gave perform le stellar effort daniel day lewi becom fan mr dano actingmr serki thought reimagin might go awri mr serki portray alfr natur alfr pennyworthmr wright fair enough gordon without fault youv seen felix leiter best leiter hard compar take gordon leiter also youv seen mr oldman anythingwel mr oldman best gordon like mr simmon best jjjamesonmr farrel believ bud cobblepot hope bring effort suppos spinoff suffic say also enjoy take bullseyebut inbrug till best mr farrellmr turturro limit still impact mr skarsgarddirectionplot appreci good work mr reev clearli put honest effort enjoy vision never felt bore distract whilst watch movi mr nolan mr burton mr timmmr dini leagu own thank mess upstori wise movi entertain well made threat hero alli must work show relev save day done quit effect life chang film rare howev storytel meaning obvious product valu impress cinematographi amaz set design use costum well thought use relevantlyoveral mevinaka fiji,positive
507,"This movie wants to be so much more than it ends up being. The tone and color palette are incredible for the majority of the movie until they inexplicably change to a pastel for the final sequence, which is jarring, underwhelming and feels like a sequence from Batman Forever being stuck into a Tim Burton Batman film.Throughout the movie you feel like you really want to love it, you appreciate the quality of the production, and yet it feels soulless.The movie is over-long with some sequences being held for so long that I'd occasionally nod off.Batman is presented as a grounded emo-type loner who patrols the streets looking for signs of trouble, and his eventual reveal as Batman is quite basic. Yes, there is a scene in which he punches someone brutally, but the rest of the fight sequence is pedestrian.Batman works a case in a noirish setting as a semi-detective who tends to just stand still, brood and gaze intently at things. And Inspector Gordon relies so much on him that one wonders whether the viewer is missing some prodigious detective skills of his.The start of the investigation into a murder is drawn-out and, again, lacks any real punch.The Riddler starts off as very mysterious and well-executed. The main issue is that he disappears for the majority of the movie only to leave clues for Batman to solve, à la the Zodiac killer, but no genuine riddles. Once he reappears at the end, he seems to lack motivation for his actions and fails to appear anything other than a deranged child. One can see they were going for a similar disturbed edginess to Heath Ledger's Joker but it doesn't deliver. And his final plot of flooding Gotham doesn't appear to be of super-villain proportions and I failed to see the genius behind that plan. Like... why?Colin Farrell as Penguin and John Turturo as Falcons are brilliant. Bruce Wayne is too emo to appear as though he has any functioning life outside his mission as either a stalker or as Batman. Alfred is underused and his relationship with Bruce seems aloof. There is one scene at the hospital where the emotion finally sets in and it pulls at your heartstrings.I loved the backstory of Bruce's father. It was a great addition.Selina Kyle is excellent.As mentioned at the start, the finale is a real letdown and underwhelming. It feels like they wanted to do something big for the finale but it just feels tropey. It doesn't feel like a natural place the story would lead to. Zack Snyder, Christopher Nolan and Tim Burton were great with the final payoffs. This movie doesn't deliver that. It's a mind-bogglingly silly ""master plan"" by the Riddler. And the Riddler loses all his initial mystique in the third act of the film when he finally reappears.And don't get me started about the silly Joker tacked on at the end. You know the director is aiming for something nightmarishly disturbed and maniacal but it doesn't work. The Joker sounds like Jim Carrey and it's silly that it's him who says ""riddle me this"" instead of the Riddler. And their scene ends with childish maniacal laughter.Paterson plays Batman well. His voice is excellent and his voiceovers at the start are brilliant. It's just too bad they didn't use more of his narration throughout the movie; it would've worked a treat.The score is excellent although tends to primarily use the one theme with slight variations.Is the movie good? Your brain tells you that you are meant to say ""yes"" because there is a lot of quality in the film itself, but the sum of the parts is where it doesn't live up to its potential. It's over-long, poorly paced, with underdeveloped characters and a main villain who shows great promise at the start but ultimately underwhelms and the finale is jarring for all the wrong reasons. It isn't epic in any manner whatsoever although you know that's what they are trying for: but all they deliver is something tonally very different from the rest of the film, and the villainous plan is a head-scratcher due to its mediocrity.You will watch it once at the theatre and you will tell yourself ""I think it's good but I don't know why. Maybe I should watch it at home when it's released on home video so I can give it another go."" How many times will you watch it? Depends on your taste. Given how slow and long it is, my guess is that I'll only watch it one more time when it's released at home... but even then I'm unsure and not excited by that prospect.Did they make a mistake by making this movie? Not at all. I'm interested in such a different take and I'm happy it exists and that I got to watch it. It has some incredible moments. But that's it.Current number of views: 1 time at theatre (advanced screening).",movi want much end tone color palett incred major movi inexplic chang pastel final sequenc jar underwhelm feel like sequenc batman forev stuck tim burton batman filmthroughout movi feel like realli want love appreci qualiti product yet feel soullessth movi overlong sequenc held long id occasion nod offbatman present ground emotyp loner patrol street look sign troubl eventu reveal batman quit basic ye scene punch someon brutal rest fight sequenc pedestrianbatman work case noirish set semidetect tend stand still brood gaze intent thing inspector gordon reli much one wonder whether viewer miss prodigi detect skill histh start investig murder drawnout lack real punchth riddler start mysteri wellexecut main issu disappear major movi leav clue batman solv la zodiac killer genuin riddl reappear end seem lack motiv action fail appear anyth derang child one see go similar disturb edgi heath ledger joker doesnt deliv final plot flood gotham doesnt appear supervillain proport fail see geniu behind plan like whycolin farrel penguin john turturo falcon brilliant bruce wayn emo appear though function life outsid mission either stalker batman alfr underus relationship bruce seem aloof one scene hospit emot final set pull heartstringsi love backstori bruce father great additionselina kyle excellenta mention start final real letdown underwhelm feel like want someth big final feel tropey doesnt feel like natur place stori would lead zack snyder christoph nolan tim burton great final payoff movi doesnt deliv mindbogglingli silli master plan riddler riddler lose initi mystiqu third act film final reappearsand dont get start silli joker tack end know director aim someth nightmarishli disturb maniac doesnt work joker sound like jim carrey silli say riddl instead riddler scene end childish maniac laughterpaterson play batman well voic excel voiceov start brilliant bad didnt use narrat throughout movi wouldv work treatth score excel although tend primarili use one theme slight variationsi movi good brain tell meant say ye lot qualiti film sum part doesnt live potenti overlong poorli pace underdevelop charact main villain show great promis start ultim underwhelm final jar wrong reason isnt epic manner whatsoev although know that tri deliv someth tonal differ rest film villain plan headscratch due mediocrityy watch theatr tell think good dont know mayb watch home releas home video give anoth go mani time watch depend tast given slow long guess ill watch one time releas home even im unsur excit prospectdid make mistak make movi im interest differ take im happi exist got watch incred moment that itcurr number view time theatr advanc screen,neutral

514,"I was able to see the movie yesterday. So let me start of saying that the movie is amazing.The tone and the visuals really hit different and it's a different Batman movie than all the previous iterations. Matt Reeves and Peter Craig really are a skilled writer set and the plot, the dialogues and even the humor are sharply written! Kudos to both of them. The score of the movie is amazing! Please do not listen to it before the movie. You need to hear and see the combination of visuals and the movie. It's full on amazing. Michael Giacchino has perfectly crafted a score for ages. In certain scenes I could feel my excitement and my adrenaline pump just because of the score. It's a very long movie, so it really does take its time in developing the story and the characters. I found myself liking the first 2/3s a bit more than the final stretch but overall it was amazingly told from start to finish.The visuals, fight scenes and the camera work is very well crafted too. There's no shaky cam scenes, no fight scene is shot too close. And one particular scene had my jaw dropping.I tried to avoid all the trailers and promo material to not spoiler the movie for me so I kind of went in not knowing and from the opening the movie turned out to be way darker than I expected it to be. But it's a good thing honestly and I am full on with it if it turns out to be a trilogy. And with that said people will try to compare it to TDK which in my opinion isn't fair because TDK was the second Part in a trilogy. This movie here should be compared to Batman Begins. And to answer the question. Yes I think it's better than Batman begins. And if Matt reeves can keep up the good writing and really develop the story even more we might have a better overall trilogy of Batman!And one more thing which I find very important. Since the movie is rated PG-13 i would still advise parents to have a second thought about taking younger children to the movies. It's a very dark movie and very intense. I personally think it's even a bit hard for some teenagers who might react sensitive to the themes and scenes of the movie.",abl see movi yesterday let start say movi amazingth tone visual realli hit differ differ batman movi previou iter matt reev peter craig realli skill writer set plot dialogu even humor sharpli written kudo score movi amaz plea listen movi need hear see combin visual movi full amaz michael giacchino perfectli craft score age certain scene could feel excit adrenalin pump score long movi realli take time develop stori charact found like first bit final stretch overal amazingli told start finishth visual fight scene camera work well craft there shaki cam scene fight scene shot close one particular scene jaw droppingi tri avoid trailer promo materi spoiler movi kind went know open movi turn way darker expect good thing honestli full turn trilog said peopl tri compar tdk opinion isnt fair tdk second part trilog movi compar batman begin answer question ye think better batman begin matt reev keep good write realli develop stori even might better overal trilog batmanand one thing find import sinc movi rate pg would still advis parent second thought take younger child movi dark movi intens person think even bit hard teenag might react sensit theme scene movi,positive

But if you are hoping for an amazing new Batman iteration, good means it wasn't great, let alone amazing.This review will come off as negative but I did enjoy it. I love the tone. It's super dark and grounded in reality, even more than the Nolan trilogy. And it feels true to the character. Zoe Kravitz and Jeffrey Wright are great casting choices. It's a mostly well-made film and a good addition to the franchise. And the Bat suit looks awesome.At the same time, nothing about this movie wowed me. I did not connect with the characters, especially the villain. The relationships seem undeveloped and not organic. I was not nearly as emotionally invested in the story as I should have been.

518,"I'll say it started pretty good and I liked the cinematography. But I thought it dragged on, and the social commentary on destroying ""white privileged men"" was ironic as that's what Batman is- a privileged white rich guy who can mascarade as a vigilante because he's rich and has all the free time to do so; and we feel for him because boo boo he's an orphan. This was a very obvious ""woke"" fest. I like the diversity but it's when they blatantly shove rhetoric down your throat that it starts to become cringey. Pattinson was so sleepy, like Joe Biden in a Batman suit sleepy. Joker is my favorite movie of all time and I feel like they tried to go for that but it just had too many missteps.

519,"THE BATMAN (2022) *** Robert Pattinson, Zoe Kravitz, Jeffrey Wright, Colin Farrell, Paul Dano, John Turturro, Andy Serkis, Peter Sarsgaard. Filmmaker Matt Reeves pulls out all the stops in this even darker adaptation of the Bob Kane comic book hero with Pattinson standing tall and brooding as Bruce Wayne employing vigilante style justice as The Caped Cursader while Gotham quakes under the siege of the homicidal Riddler (Dano affectively disturbing) and gaining an unlikely ally in Selina Kyle (ass-kicking Kravitz in pre-Catwoman mode). Arresting visuals thanks in large part to ace cinematography by Greig Fraser and James Chinlund's production design all aided by the foreboding score by Michael Giacchino full of bombast and dread.

520,"I will say I liked the story, but the long dragged out and slowly paced near 3 hours was ridiculous. You could watch this at 1.5x speed and it would be more enjoyable. This needed at least 20 mins cut out and much faster storytelling. And the constant whisper dialogue in most of the film became annoying really fast.I do like Pattinson as an actor, but not as Batman in this one. He wasn't convincing and his monotonic whispering dialogue and Emo demeanor was very lackluster to the point of cringeworthy. And that's him both as Batman and even more so as Bruce Wayne.And what's with Colin Farrell being cast with all these prosthetics to play the Penguin? Was every other actor that naturally has that character's look unavailable? It's not like Farrell has a particular set of Penguin skills lol. Casting Farrell as Batman and Pattinson as Penguin, now that would've worked much better imo.I'm also a big fan of Westworld's Jeffrey Wright, but here again, he was very unconvincing as Gordon, especially when he also had that monotonic whispering Emo demeanor. I get that director and joint writer Reeves was going for that dark lonely dreary theme, but instead, the characters looked bored and inexperienced actors with sore throats.The only one that nailed their character perfectly was the lovely and beautiful Kravitz, who stole the entire show. I would've rather watched a 4+ hour movie with just her as Catwoman.All the Affleck, Keaton, Bale, Kilmer and even Clooney Batman characters were much more convincing, as well as having more and better ""keep you awake"" action in said films.Sadly, this one is a generous yet disappointing 6/10 from me.",say like stori long drag slowli pace near hour ridicul could watch x speed would enjoy need least min cut much faster storytel constant whisper dialogu film becam annoy realli fasti like pattinson actor batman one wasnt convinc monoton whisper dialogu emo demeanor lacklust point cringeworthi that batman even bruce wayneand what colin farrel cast prosthet play penguin everi actor natur charact look unavail like farrel particular set penguin skill lol cast farrel batman pattinson penguin wouldv work much better imoim also big fan westworld jeffrey wright unconvinc gordon especi also monoton whisper emo demeanor get director joint writer reev go dark lone dreari theme instead charact look bore inexperienc actor sore throatsth one nail charact perfectli love beauti kravitz stole entir show wouldv rather watch hour movi catwomanal affleck keaton bale kilmer even clooney batman charact much convinc well better keep awak action said filmssadli one gener yet disappoint,positive
521,"I'm not sure where to begin as I don't generally want to spoil the reveals, but the big twists in the film were very anticlimactic. For 'The Batman'; Matt Reeves seemed to borrow from some of the bigger books such as 'Batman: Year One', 'Hush', and 'Batman: The Long Halloween'. Reeves also leaned heavily onto films such as 'The French Connection', 'Zodiac', and the noir classic 'Chinatown'. The general feel of the movie sought to relate Batman in the detective role that he's famous for in the comics, but unfortunately ignores any attempt at Batman's level of crime & mystery.The acting was really good. There's a great cast of professionals in this film, although Robert Patterson isn't allowed a range of emotion. Bruce Wayne and Batman are completely indistinguishable as the tired emo-kid who walks through life with severe lethargy. Colin Farrell is unrecognizable as the Penguin, and dare I say gave the greatest performance of his life. A large portion of the film is writing out a semi-origin story for Oswald Cobblepot and his rise to become Gotham's crime boss. A lot of the villains are the origin stories here. Batman (the character) is basically introduced the way he is in 'Batman: Year Two' and I thought that was a mistake. Year one of Batman would have been wonderful on screen. The audience seeing Bruce Wayne learning to use fear in his early days would have been a relief to this movie's ""Everyone is just scared of him."" plot device. Zoe Kravitz's performance as Selena Kyle becoming Cat Woman was under-developed, as she was so much fun to watch in 'The Batman' that I'd like to see this spin-off into a stand-alone Cat Woman release. Jeffery Wright was brilliant (of course) even remaining quiet in the Batman's background he pulled the attention onto himself, mostly because Patterson's portrayal was incredibly stiff. Paul Dano as The Riddler was exactly what I wanted to see in this movie. The character reached a new level of applause as a serial killer, but saddly that part of the plot was put on the back burner for the lackluster crime drama with Carmine Falcone. John Turturro was great as the crime boss Falcone, but the plot focused too long on his side story rather than offering more clues about the killings. It dragged on so long that it bored me completely. I went into 'The Batman' to see him match wits with a clever serial killer, not be re-educated about the connection between Thomas Wayne & Carmine Falcone again.The action sequences with the car chases and the fight choreography seemed old fashioned in a way. I knew before hand that Reeves lifted from some older better known films, but it's as if they dropped the budget on these scenes. Batman racing to catch the Penguin was an old muscle car Batmobile versus (what I'm guessing was) a 1980's Buick. I was laughing at this chase scene... it was presented with such seriousness that maybe if Penguin were in an expensive Italian sports car, I might have enjoyed it. But it was literally a supped-up car desperately trying to out pace my mom's car. The fighting was dull. Hand to hand combat is one of the first things Bruce Wayne learns before donning the cowl. But in this movie Batman is throwing punches a newly trained boxer would scoff at. So much of these scenes were empty and devoid of thrills and chills, that I wondered where the editor was.'The Batman' is simply too long. It's a ridiculous attempt to impress fans of it's own significance. It fails at cohesive story-telling and it basically pats itself on the back throughout the unnecessary musical score.

526,"What's the one thought you had when Warner Bros. Casted Robert Pattinson as the Batman? Mine was 'Nooooooo!!!'. I was bewildered on the decision, questioning if this the best they've got for Batman? I didn't hate him but I was concerned if he could take up a big role like this as he doesn't have the regular features embodied by the titular character.And today's the day I witness myself that I was wrong, Pattinson is a great Batman. Hell, he slayed as Batman! Yes, his features don't really resemble the classic Batman, but he made it his own! This is one Batman that is better than Ben Affleck and George Clooney and audience would compare him to the likes of Christian Bale and Michael Keaton. Also, there's something about Pattinson's jawline that complements his looks everytime he's wearing the mask. He oozes his seemingly mysterious vibe that appears alluring enough for audience.2022's The Batman runs for about 3 hours long and what's special about this one is it offers a journey that doesn't dive into its origin story, making it a different piece compared to others. It's not centred on 'my parents were killed in the back of an alley when I was a kid', but it takes on a different story, focusing more on Gotham city and its grim corruption happening within.It's engaging throughout though it's not meant for some viewers because... the narrative isn't made for audience preferring commercial films. I would say the context and story are as rich as The Dark Knight and Joker. If you have a big issue with these two, I mean this as no offense but stick to Marvel.Like one of those PS4 Batman games, the film offers a bleak and dreary look at Gotham, transporting the audience into a world of transparency and reality. It doesn't shy away from showing us the rawness of the city; the coal-coloured alleys and underground tunnels, the debris scattered on the floor and the hard-hitting fact that no one is safe therefore, audience has an easy time relating themselves with our world filled with arising problems and issues.If you're wondering Zoe Kravitz did a good job as Catwoman, I would say yes. However, she's my least favourite compared to others who have held the same role like Michelle Pfeiffer & Anne Hathaway. She could've been better.Kudos to the makeup department for putting on such a brilliant work for Mr Penguin. If I hadn't known that was Colin Farrell, I would not have recognized him even a bit. Farrell did an excellent job as Penguin but there were a few times that he reminded me of Jared Leto's in House of Gucci with the overused accent🤣. And his character was mostly missing in the second half which was a let-down for me.What a brave decision when they did a 180° turn on The Riddler. They realized that Gotham is a dark place, they changed Riddler into someone darker than what the comic has offered. The Riddler is profoundly menacing and he will remind you of Heath's Joker in TDK once in a while. Paul Dano did a great job but... I felt they could have picked another actor. Prolly that's just me but hey, Dano is 👏👍.One of the issues I have is the overused soundtrack. For all 3 hours long, rarely you will encounter a scene with no music background 🤣. It takes away a bit of the grounded experience and the suspense that comes from it. If only they restrained the music much more, I believe this film would be scarier. What's worse is the music that was playing sounded quite the same with the next, it comes to a point where I felt irritated by it.Also, I wasn't impressed by the climax scene. It feels like they are not giving their best shot. It's just not 'ummphhh' enough as what has been hinted in the first two hours. Just when you thought it's the beginning of an exciting final battle scene is apparently almost the end of the movie.The reason behind this might probably be because of the not-so-formidable villain. Let's take a recent example, The Riddler is somewhat similar to Rami Malek's Safin in No Time to Die in terms of his capabilities and abilities; they both ace in strategy and planning but weak in combating, resulting in an almost non-existent final battle.Verdict: As if like a bleak painting canvas sold at a prestigious auction, The Batman exhibits an ambitious look into Gotham's gritty landscape all along strongly coloured with a frighteningly dour tone, illuminating what could possibly be the best movie of the year so far.",what one thought warner bro cast robert pattinson batman mine nooooooo bewild decis question best theyv got batman didnt hate concern could take big role like doesnt regular featur embodi titular characterand today day wit wrong pattinson great batman hell slay batman ye featur dont realli resembl classic batman made one batman better ben affleck georg clooney audienc would compar like christian bale michael keaton also there someth pattinson jawlin complement look everytim he wear mask ooz seemingli mysteri vibe appear allur enough audienc batman run hour long what special one offer journey doesnt dive origin stori make differ piec compar other centr parent kill back alley kid take differ stori focus gotham citi grim corrupt happen withinit engag throughout though meant viewer narr isnt made audienc prefer commerci film would say context stori rich dark knight joker big issu two mean offens stick marvellik one p batman game film offer bleak dreari look gotham transport audienc world transpar realiti doesnt shi away show u raw citi coalcolour alley underground tunnel debri scatter floor hardhit fact one safe therefor audienc easi time relat world fill aris problem issuesif your wonder zoe kravitz good job catwoman would say ye howev she least favourit compar other held role like michel pfeiffer ann hathaway couldv betterkudo makeup depart put brilliant work mr penguin hadnt known colin farrel would recogn even bit farrel excel job penguin time remind jare leto hous gucci overus accent charact mostli miss second half letdown mewhat brave decis turn riddler realiz gotham dark place chang riddler someon darker comic offer riddler profoundli menac remind heath joker tdk paul dano great job felt could pick anoth actor prolli that hey dano one issu overus soundtrack hour long rare encount scene music background take away bit ground experi suspens come restrain music much believ film would scarier what wors music play sound quit next come point felt irrit italso wasnt impress climax scene feel like give best shot ummphhh enough hint first two hour thought begin excit final battl scene appar almost end movieth reason behind might probabl notsoformid villain let take recent exampl riddler somewhat similar ramus malek safin time die term capabl abil ace strategi plan weak combat result almost nonexist final battleverdict like bleak paint canva sold prestigi auction batman exhibit ambiti look gotham gritti landscap along strongli colour frighteningli dour tone illumin could possibl best movi year far,neutral

528,"I really don't understand all the love this movie gets. As most of you all have read, there are people out there that think The Batman is better than any of the Dark Knight trilogy or either of Burton's movies and I really don't understand it. Pattinson is horribly miss cast, the story kind of loses itself as it progresses and the score has one good track that is played over and over. I know the director was trying to make this the most grounded and realistic Batman to date but in doing so, he made it unbelievable... what's up with Batman being so accessible and accepted around cops that at times he walks amongst them like he's one of them? If someone really wanted to find out the identity of Batman, couldn't they use facial recognition technology by taking his picture while he's hanging around? The Batman I am more familiar with lurks in the shadows and really only talks to Gordon and other people in his inner circle.There were some things I liked about the movie...I did give it a 6/10. The set design and the overall feel of Gotham was really cool and made me think of Seven which the director was obviously going for. Collin Farrell as Oz/The Penguin stole every scene he was in, I liked Wright as Gordon and Paul Dano's Riddler was extremely creepy.I have tried watching the movie again and did like it more the second time but I still think it's the most overrated movie to come out in the last few years.",realli dont understand love movi get read peopl think batman better dark knight trilog either burton movi realli dont understand pattinson horribl miss cast stori kind lose progress score one good track play know director tri make ground realist batman date made unbeliev what batman access accept around cop time walk amongst like he one someon realli want find ident batman couldnt use facial recognit technolog take pictur he hang around batman familiar lurk shadow realli talk gordon peopl inner circlether thing like moviei give set design overal feel gotham realli cool made think seven director obvious go collin farrel ozth penguin stole everi scene like wright gordon paul dano riddler extrem creepyi tri watch movi like second time still think overr movi come last year,positive
529,"The Batman (2022) is a movie my wife and I caught an advanced screening of last night. The storyline follows Gotham shortly after ""The Batman"" has emerged and established himself in the streets. A serial killer known as The Riddler starts a killing spree of everyone influential within Gotham's hierarchy until Bruce Wayne in inevitably the target. How are all of these people tied together and can Batman tie the pieces together before Wayne is the next victim?This movie is directed by Matt Reeves (Cloverfield) and stars Robert Pattinson (Twilight), Zoë Kravitz (Kimi), Colin Farrell (Total Recall), Paul Dano (There Will be Blood), John Turturro (Do the Right Thing), Peter Sarsgaard (Garden State), Andy Serkis (Lord of the Rings), Jeffrey Wright (Shaft) and Barry Keoghan (Eternals).The storyline, look and feel of this movie is an A+. The characters are perfectly cast and well executed. Farrell, Dano and Kravitz were a 10/10.This movie does a fantastic job of depicting the Batman universe with the appropriate grit and feel and the lighting and cinematography is excellent. This also did a good job of creating various potential spinoffs with some subtle references within the storyline and at the end. This has a very good Jeph Loeb comics feel to it and does a good job delivering the ""Detective"" elements of Batman. The violence was also brilliant and very well done. I will say this did not need to be 3-hours and there are an abundance of scenes that could have been better edited. This film likely should have been a hair under 2 and a half hours.Overall this is a magnificent addition to the super hero genre and an absolute must see for Batman fans.

537,"""It's a big city. I can't be everywhere."" Batman (Rob Pattison)
A more complete adaptation of the Batman comics presence there isn't, and no more gothic, spot-on condemnation of human frailty since the 50-year-old Godfather. Writer/director Matt Reeves' The Batman is arguably the definitive dark night of the American soul in its corruption and its salvation. As an achievement of robust American neo noir, it ranks somewhere behind Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver and Godfather.Batman (Rob Pattinson) scowls as if he came from a Twilight frame of mind while he shows a soft side in his love for Selena Kyle/Cat Woman (Zoe Kravitz), the Bat and the Cat, working to save the city from the likes of Riddler (Paul Dano), Penguin (Colin Farrell), and crime lord Carmine Falcone (John Turturro). Besides offing a large number of corrupt city employees, they offer Bruce Wayne a chance to learn about his obsession with his parents' public and private lives and their untimely deaths. Although none of the bad boys eclipses the impact of Heath Ledger's multidimensional Joker, even in his humor, together they are a powerful cast of darkness.Besides bringing together an ensemble of estimable actors in every role, Reeves gathers expert cinematographer Greig Fraser and production designer James Chinlund to create a darkness full of telling images while competing with the great film noir compositions of all time. Dark, yes, obscure, no. The darkness that envelopes each scene says more about the bleak side of humanity than any written treatise could.Besides the corruption of city officials, The Batman casts a shadow over the virtue of vengeance, embodied in Wayne's longing to account for the death of his parents and bad-boys like Riddler to assuage the pain of his childhood by terrorizing the city. In his favor, Riddler is ridding the city of corrupt power while Batman is cleaning it of its petty criminals. His stalwart ally, Lt. James Gordon (Jeffrey Wright), realizes that the real crimes are housed in his police force and ultimately his supervisors.The Batman is a hip and incisive representation of modern angst that not even a hero can relieve, at least not right now:To the strains of Nirvana's baleful Something In The Way: ""They think I'm hiding in the shadows, but I AM the shadows.""

538,"This film delivers a much darker and more sinister Batman, quite unlike the many versions that have gone before. The representation of Gotham as well, is steeped in corruption and decay. The story opens with the death of the city's mayor, and from there introduces the principal characters that are part of the Batman legacy that are known all too well by fans. In tone, I think this film was more like the ""Gotham"" cable series than any of the prior movies, even if that show had more to do with the young Bruce Wayne growing into the masked crime fighter. The villains both in ""Gotham"" and in this story personified the evil and malice that gripped Batman's hometown, with an added element of corruption in the background of Bruce Wayne's father that put him under the thumb of crime boss Carmine Falcone (John Turturro).All of the performances here were exceptional. Robert Pattinson's take on Batman was more effective than his portrayal of Bruce Wayne, who looked like he was part of the grunge scene. I didn't much care for the Batman outfit, it looked unusually heavy and clunky; one's first inkling that Batman was arriving was heralded by the thumping footsteps one might associate with ""Jurassic Park"". Pattinson's voice as Batman, as well as those of Lieutenant Gordon (Jeffrey Wright) and The Riddler (Paul Dano) sounded like they were coming through a synthesizer. It made for dramatic effect, although not quite realistic.This film version of The Riddler is not like anything you've seen before or would have expected. His off-screen portrayals hinted at a demented masked vigilante, which made the actual appearance of the character that much more compelling when it revealed an almost baby faced Dano in the role of a psychotic madman. Quite honestly, it wasn't until the credits rolled that I became aware that Colin Farrell had the role of Oz, hidden underneath all the prosthetics and make-up. Yes, he was referred to as The Penguin, but it wasn't overdone, and his full name (Oswald Cobblepot) was never mentioned.Rounding out the principals was Zoe Kravitz as the slinky Catwoman, Selina Kyle. She had some major kick butt action in the film, and rose to the occasion to save Batman's near the end of the story. Speaking of which, even with his seemingly armor plated outfit, Batman appeared unusually vulnerable to attacks by his foes in the picture. It marked him as more human than the average super-hero with unusual powers.I will say this, your attention needs to be focused due to the nuances that are revealed in the telling of Bruce Wayne's parents' story and how he might have been misled growing up. His father's relationship with Falcone and fellow mob boss Salvatore Moroni bear on Gotham's reputation. Maybe it was inadvertent, but there might have been a subliminal tribute to the ""Gotham"" series here with the character of Falcone associate Kenzie (Peter McDonald). The role of James Gordon in that series was portrayed by Ben McKenzie.",film deliv much darker sinist batman quit unlik mani version gone represent gotham well steep corrupt decay stori open death citi mayor introduc princip charact part batman legaci known well fan tone think film like gotham cabl seri prior movi even show young bruce wayn grow mask crime fighter villain gotham stori personifi evil malic grip batman hometown ad element corrupt background bruce wayn father put thumb crime bos carmin falcon john turturroal perform except robert pattinson take batman effect portray bruce wayn look like part grung scene didnt much care batman outfit look unusu heavi clunki one first inkl batman arriv herald thump footstep one might associ jurass park pattinson voic batman well lieuten gordon jeffrey wright riddler paul dano sound like come synthes made dramat effect although quit realisticthi film version riddler like anyth youv seen would expect offscreen portray hint dement mask vigilant made actual appear charact much compel reveal almost babi face dano role psychot madman quit honestli wasnt credit roll becam awar colin farrel role oz hidden underneath prosthet makeup ye refer penguin wasnt overdon full name oswald cobblepot never mentionedround princip zoe kravitz slinki catwoman selina kyle major kick butt action film rose occas save batman near end stori speak even seemingli armor plate outfit batman appear unusu vulner attack foe pictur mark human averag superhero unusu powersi say attent need focus due nuanc reveal tell bruce wayn parent stori might misl grow father relationship falcon fellow mob bos salvator moroni bear gotham reput mayb inadvert might sublimin tribut gotham seri charact falcon associ kenzi peter mcdonald role jame gordon seri portray ben mckenzi,neutral

543,"I assume there are still people out there that cannot stand Robert Pattinson. This dislike was born when he accepted one of the main roles in the Twilight universe. If you are one of those, I do not think I will be able to sway you - to convince you otherwise. I could tell you, that he has proven himself as an actor in many films since then. And when I say that I am not trying to put the Twilight Saga down. I was not the target audience of that - still I saw some interesting things in there, but also things that I did not like at all.But this is about ... The Batman! A distinction in the title - maybe to be able to find it better when browsing or looking for it. Because and I'm sure you are aware of that: there are many other movies called Batman. Actually before Marvel took over the reigns, DC was the one producing good comic book movies. Superman and Batman being the most noteable ones. No one back then thought of combining the heroes though. Everyone stayed in their lane. Something this movie does too. And maybe it is better if DC does not emulate or copy the MCU formula ... I understand that it is more than tempting considering all the money that is involved of course.All that history aside, this as I already said, is a standalone movie. This is about The Batman! And while you may have your favorite (Keaton, West or Bale - though maybe even Affleck or the unlikely choice of Kilmer or Clooney), do not condemn the Patts just yet. He really transforms and gets into the role ... a role that anyone should consider an honor to play.I am overall a MCU fan boy as some may call me. But I have a deep love for the Bats. And while that makes me at least somewhat biased, this is not the reason I am surprised the movie has such a high rating. I am surprised because the movie is long (even if you don't really feel it - even when you may think at times ""alright we have spent quite a lot of time lingering haven't we?"") and because it is quite dark ... pun intended. The tone and the overall lighting of the movie.There is violence here - things that a decade or so ago, you may not have been able to get away with and still get a PG13 rating. Bashing of the head with a blunt object? Yes you don't get close ups and there is not as much blood to be seen as with other movies that also have head bashings - but just the thought and certain glimpses we get to see ... is more than enough.But all that and the fact this is a detective story ... really help elevate the movie. That and a strong cast of people. I thought Jared Leto had one of the greatest transformations for House of Gucci ... but Colin Farrell actually isn't recognizable in this. And would also fit in the House of Gucci, considering the italian accent/New York slang he uses.The darkness and the shadows play a big role. And you may find yourself looking to find something in them ... even something (or someone?) that doesn't exist/is there. The action scenes are really well played out - there is even one that reminisces that feeling you may have had playing a game or two with the Batman. Arkham City may arguably be the best game of the series - with a fighting system that really is extraordinary. Many have tried to copy it - but I never felt that seemless flow in anything else I've played since then.And then there is the sound system ... I watched it in Imax too, though it doesn't seem to have been filmed with an Imax camera. Still bigger screen so all good. But the sound ... wow! Just wow - incredible.So while I still feel that The Dark Knight is a bit better - this comes as close as they get. Coincidences and convenient timing aside. Because a lot of things have to go right (or wrong depending on your perspective) for the movie and the story to work ... still small and minor ""flaws"" like that aside - because that should not stop you from enjoying this very well made movie.Edit: Since this is not an origin story, but still the beginnings of Batman, he is not invincible and he may not have every gimmick/toy/car/vehicle you may expect him to have. There is one truly great car chase though ... I personally would not compare it to the real great ones you may have seen (Bullit, French Connection and so forth) and just see it as a thing that works on its own. Also the added bonus - after credits ""scene"" - is really not something that many will think worthwhile ... as in worth staying and watching the credits through to get this ... well let's call it easter egg, that is not really a scene, but a callback to a scene from earlier ... with a promise for the future one may say.

544,"You've seen a million Batman movies, but you still need to steel yourself for the darkest Dark Knight yet. Starring Robert Pattinson as DC's Caped Crusader, 2022's new movie The Batman is an intense, apocalyptic cinematic experience. Following the famous murder of Bruce Waynes parents, Wayne is two years into his crusade against Gotham City street crime. As Batman unpicks the cryptic clues, the investigation peels away a greater conspiracy. But the real riddle is how the ranting killer's twisted motive ties back to Batman himself. He Batman (in theaters March 4) is barely a superhero movie, Christopher Nolan's criminal politics and Zack Snyder's operatic brutality, plus the standalone Joker movie's psychological backstory, vaguely timeless design and layers of dark irony. Most of all, The Batman is a straight up horror film. This new flick is PG-13, but it's on a whole other level from the relatively bloodless Dark Knight movies -- and on a different planet from any Marvel film -- immersing you in a nerve-shredding three hours of escalating dread and simmering pain garnished with some astonishingly nasty, and dark touches, and makes think what one man can go through because of loosing his parents. You absolutely 100% can't show The Batman to a child, it will give them nightmares, and bad thoughts. Robert Pattinson's batman is lank-haired mess, and is a world away from Christian Bales outstanding professional look. This darkest Dark Knight may not be for everyone (and certainly not kids), but it's a gripping and nerve-shredding Bat-thriller. The one thing that Matt Reeves explores that Christopher Nolan doesn't is how dark and how can he make it to the story, and comic, and even a horror movie. The Batman should have been rated R not PG-13 because how intense, Dark and scary it is. The soundtrack was done by Michael Giacchino, its very graceful incorporation of specific themes for Batman and Selina, as well as pre-existing music ranging from classical pieces to Nirvana, provides tonal variation to ensure that The Batman never becomes a punishing downer.

548,"Greetings from Lithuania.""The Batman"" (2022) for me personally was not as entertaining as Christopher Nolan's take in ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy. If i would compare this movie to Nolan's series, it would be more close to ""The Dark Knight"". That said i liked ""The Batman"" for its being very faithful adaptation of Batman universe itself. I saw two or three DC' animated Batman movies and this film was more in common with those then any other Batman movie ever made.""The Batman"" (2022) is a very dark movie, and i mean that in every way. In a whole 3 hours running time there is basically scene or two set in day time. And 98% of the film is set during night, and looks like in Gotham it is always raining. It is a very gritty and down to earth setting, and that i liked about it. The atmosphere of this movie highly reminded me of ""Se7en"" (1995). Performances were good and Robert Pattinson was a superb as Batman. Yet i think it was Zoë Kravitz who stole the show.Overall, ""The Batman"" (2022) is a dark, gritty and very down to earth adaptation of Batman. For younger audiences who grew up on watching Marvel movies (no offence - i really enjoy them as well) this adaptation of Batman will be a test of patience - this movie is not for everyone and reminded me of ""Joker"" (2019) more then any other comic book movie.

553,"As director Matt Reeves repeatedly emphasized in several interviews before its release, ""The Batman"" is a detective noir with a dark atmosphere from beginning to end. If you look at scenes reminiscent of David Fincher's Se7en, the appearance of corrupt Gotham City's public power, politicians, and mafias, you also can enjoy this film as a crime drama. Godam City's gloomy appearance, created by director Matt Reeves, is fantastic. Thanks to the ability of Greg Fraser, the cinematographer of ""Rogue One"" and ""Dune,"" the overall visual beauty of ""The Batman"" is next level compared to average superhero movies. The script written by Matt Reeves and Peter Craig is also commendable. As soon as the movie begins, it welcomes the audience with an event that lays out the main plot of the film. Despite the 176-minute running time, which is nearly three hours long, there is no useless scene. It boldly omits Batman's origin and presents a young Batman who has only been active for two years. It feels as if Reeves is responding to criticisms imposed on Zack Snyder's Batman, such as ""He did not make good use of Batman's detective aspect"" and ""Batman is a murderer in this"". Reeves emphasizes Batman's 'Detective' identity as much as possible and shows the philosophy of ""not using a gun"" through dialogue and action.It does not make mistakes that ""Batman v. Superman"" made, such as packing too much storyline in the movie, or being too focused on setting up the sequel.Director Matt Reeves have teased a potential sequel, but at the same time, he argued that the first film should be able to work & stand on its own. Director Reeves' work, The Batman, succeeded in creating an impressive work with the story of Batman's growth, relationships with new characters, and Ridler's murder game. Warner Brothers, who had to go through a lot of critical or commercial failure due to excessive interference in the production of films such as Justice League and Suicide Squad, turned to guarantee the freedom of creators as much as possible. As a result, a work that reveals Matt Reeves' ambitious vision was born.Over the past few years, DC has disappointed a lot of people, and it is also true that it has become difficult to see DC go up to the same position as Marvel and compete with them. However, recently, films such as ""Joker"" and ""The Suicide Squad,"" masterpieces that utilize DC's unique personality and creator's vision have appeared, and ""The Batman"" seems to have no problem standing next to it. I hope that Matt Reeves will be able to complete a trilogy that utilizes his vision safely without following the path of SnyderVerse. Now DC has found its own way, not just copying Marvel. And ""The Batman"" is another step toward that path.",director matt reev repeatedli emphas sever interview releas batman detect noir dark atmospher begin end look scene reminisc david fincher seen appear corrupt gotham citi public power politician mafia also enjoy film crime drama godam citi gloomi appear creat director matt reev fantast thank abil greg fraser cinematograph rogu one dune overal visual beauti batman next level compar averag superhero movi script written matt reev peter craig also commend soon movi begin welcom audienc event lay main plot film despit minut run time nearli three hour long useless scene boldli omit batman origin present young batman activ two year feel reev respond critic impos zack snyder batman make good use batman detect aspect batman murder reev emphas batman detect ident much possibl show philosophi use gun dialogu actionit make mistak batman v superman made pack much storylin movi focus set sequeldirector matt reev tea potenti sequel time argu first film abl work stand director reev work batman succeed creat impress work stori batman growth relationship new charact ridler murder game warner brother go lot critic commerci failur due excess interfer product film justic leagu suicid squad turn guarante freedom creator much possibl result work reveal matt reev ambiti vision bornov past year dc disappoint lot peopl also true becom difficult see dc go posit marvel compet howev recent film joker suicid squad masterpiec util dc uniqu person creator vision appear batman seem problem stand next hope matt reev abl complet trilog util vision safe without follow path snydervers dc found way copi marvel batman anoth step toward path,neutral

I mean you can never forget fight club's reveal scene, Forrest Gump's runs & accent, all Heath Ledger's Joker scenes .. etc , u see where I'm getting here?It's an uneventful movie, a time burner at best. Probably my main issue with it is that I think of Christopher Nolan's trilogy as the bar for any superhero movie there is while this one is attempting a heavy burden of running with Nolan's legacy in its fanbase's minds - yes, Ben Affleck didn't happen for me - and to be honest everything here pales into comparison. I liked how they tried hard to keep the Batman grounded to a realistic human view of the hero's abilities and resources and that's always a great thing for me personally, I get detached from the story otherwise but I think they overdid it to the exctent it de-glorified Batman, I mean aside from the worse casting, the slow story and the meh production, even the little details like the suit, his ugly shoe are noticeably bad!!

565,"Yes, it may be the billionth Batman film in recent memory- but The Batman is easily among the best, if not the best, Batman films ever made. Everything works in this movie, and I mean everything. From the cinematography, to the visuals, set direction, score, acting, direction, writing- it never fails, and it never lets up. There are a few tiny predictable things here and there, but none really take an impact on the quality of the movie, nor the story its telling. It is 3 hours long, but the runtime passes fast, and honestly I never wanted it to end. Robert pattinson is just fantastic in this film, a Batman for the ages, and honestly my favorite film adaptation of the character yet. The rest of the supporting cast is also excellent, Jeffrey Wright bringing a new layer onto the character of Commissioner Gordon, as well as zoe Kravitz with her excellent portrayal of Selena Kyle (aka Catwoman). It's Paul Dano's Riddler that really takes the film by storm however, easily delivering the best villain performance in a superhero film in recent memory, whose zodiac style roots really intensify a new look to the iconic character. Colin Farrell is also excellent as the Penguin in the film, and I hope we get to see more use out of him in the future. Perhaps the most signature thing about this film is the look, a bleak and gritty look into Gotham's underworld, that really does- as director Matt Reeves said- push the limits of a PG-13 film. The look of the film is just outstanding and its hauntingly beautiful solemn poignancy is just wonderful to watch on screen- everything a true Batman fan would ever want. Not to mention the action and fight scenes throughout this film are just brilliant, easily breaking new ground, and capitalizing on its darker tone. In the end, I don't have enough words to say how much I loved The Batman. Again and again one word comes to be to describe it, extraordinary. It may seem familiar, but it's unlike anything you've seen before, and in the days of superhero movies- that's something really freaking rare.My Rating: 10/10.",ye may billionth batman film recent memori batman easili among best best batman film ever made everyth work movi mean everyth cinematographi visual set direct score act direct write never fail never let tini predict thing none realli take impact qualiti movi stori tell hour long runtim pas fast honestli never want end robert pattinson fantast film batman age honestli favorit film adapt charact yet rest support cast also excel jeffrey wright bring new layer onto charact commission gordon well zoe kravitz excel portray selena kyle aka catwoman paul dano riddler realli take film storm howev easili deliv best villain perform superhero film recent memori whose zodiac style root realli intensifi new look icon charact colin farrel also excel penguin film hope get see use futur perhap signatur thing film look bleak gritti look gotham underworld realli director matt reev said push limit pg film look film outstand hauntingli beauti solemn poignanc wonder watch screen everyth true batman fan would ever want mention action fight scene throughout film brilliant easili break new ground capit darker tone end dont enough word say much love batman one word come describ extraordinari may seem familiar unlik anyth youv seen day superhero movi that someth realli freak raremi rate,positive
566,"There is a lot to like about the new Batman film. The sound design, cinematography, and the fight and stunt choreography are its strongest aspects.

And above all else... quite frankly, very little stands out here, very little that isn't executed, in my eyes, much better in the Nolan trilogy. The performances, from Gordon to Alfred to Batman himself, aren't memorable enough, aren't engaging enough to keep the audience invested and to let go of the versions of these characters they've grown to know and love from the Nolan trilogy.The Batman is not a bad film.

570,"First of all, let's all agree that Pattinson is a good actor. However, this does not mean that every good actor can impersonate any fictional character. Some fictional characters require certain traits that need to be present in the actors that portray them. Batman is one of the darkest, toughest, meanest, manliest, scariest, most well-built, most brutal, most deeply voiced, smartest, best strategy making characters that have ever been created. In other words, Batman is the ultimate human male (without superpowers). Such features are simply not present in Pattinson, genetically speaking. On the contrary, his genetic features are somewhat feminine. Not that there's anything wrong with that, it simply is the opposite of the character's profile. No matter how tough he may try to sound, how much muscles he puts on and how much steroids he ends up injecting in his system, he simply does not fit the profile. To put things into perspective, let's ask a question. Can Pattinson portray the Punisher? The answer is a simple and plain ""NO!"" Why? Because he simply doesn't look tough enough! Batman is the punisher on cosmic steroids. He's way tougher, smarter, stronger, and darker. The reason people sometimes overlook this fact is because of Batman's moral code. So if Pattinson can't even portray the Punisher, how the heck do you cast him as the Goddamn Batman?!!Even though the movie was trying too hard to convince the viewers that this Batman was intimidating, well, ""spoiler alert"", he's not! Not even a little bit. In some scenes, you actually feel sorry for the character, which is such a shame. Of course, the main reason behind this is that the guy who's playing the character isn't. Not only did Batman lack brawn in the movie, he also lacked brains! Everybody's talking about how this movie perfectly portrays Batman as ""the world's greatest detective"". Sorry guys, but if this is what ""the world's greatest detective"" looks like to you, you should definitely read more Batman comics and maybe some Agatha Christie books too. I mean, seriously, the guy had no clue what a carpet tucker was! How the heck are people even comparing the detective work in this movie to Se7en? What was presented here wasn't even the ABCs of detective work. It was pathetic, and Batman was slightly less of an idiot than the cops around him. His suit overall was not good. He literally looked flat in it. I liked the fact that it's bullet proof, but that's about it. The cowl is the worst thing about it. It's cheap, too revealing, and makes Batman's head look like an Easter egg! I really liked the camera lenses though; that was a brilliant addition. The adrenaline shot was a good idea too. It makes total sense, and I can't remember it ever being used on the silver screen. The batmobile was another thumbs up. But wait, I have to talk about the stupid point of Batman using the front door! I mean, seriously, what the hell was Reeves even thinking? Batman is the world's greatest ninja. If he wanted to get into someplace he wasn't welcome, he'd sneak in, get whatever he needed and leave without anyone ever noticing!Believe it or not, Catwoman's casting in this flick was a much better choice than Batman's! Zoe almost fits the character's full profile. She's agile, flexible, mysterious, seductive, with sharp exotic features. Maybe a bit too exotic, but that isn't really an issue. The real issue with her is that she's too small and thin, which makes her look too fragile against her foes, making her fight scenes seem unrealistic to the viewers. But I guess they had to cast a tiny actress for the role, especially since the dude who's playing Batman is a whimp.Colin Farrell as the Penguin. Wow! Just wow! This guy took the character to a completely new level. I think it's safe to say that this is my favorite Penguin adaptation ever. Maybe even better than the comics! Farrell's acting is so good, it makes you forget that he's actually playing the character. Turturro's Falcone was spot on too. They both looked like they came straight outta The Godfather!I don't usually like it when they change anything about a comic book character, such as their ethnicity, simply because I like the live-action representation of the character to be as close to the comics as possible. But in Wright's case, I'm actually glad they did. He simply nailed the character.Now let's talk about the movie. The cinematography was really good and I really liked the film's noir theme. The score was amazing too, which added more depth to the movie's theme. Reeve's direction was good, but had its flaws. The script was very basic and lacked layers of depth. Paul Dano as The Riddler and Andy Serkis as Alfred were decent, but nothing special. The movie's runtime was way too long (it should've ended at least 30 minutes earlier). And then there's the ending.. that stupid motorcycle race between Batman and Catwoman looked like something out of a cheap Indian movie.

571,"I wanted to love this movie. I would have settled for hating it. Instead, I was bored for three hours.The movie is a sloppy buffet of darkness, rain, gloom, unnecessary narration, wooden acting, absurd dialogue, pointless characters, canyon-wide plot-holes, unresolved story arcs, flaccid motivation for the bad guys, hyper-fast cuts, eye-rolling detective work, conventionally choreographed fight scenes, a cinematic emo aesthetic, a pseudo-Gothic mis en scene, a complete lack of humor or light-hearted moments of any kind, no soul in the acting, unsophisticated writing, timid directing, and a fully-checked list of boxes from the superhero / vigilante cliche playbook.This is a partial list of my complaints. (If pressed, I could probably find a handful of good things to say, but they'd be far too inconsequential to bail this movie out of the depths of Meh.)Having grown up on Adam West's Batman, I've lived through the campiness, the avant-garde, the silly, the surreal, and the downright brilliant (I'm looking at you Dark Knight). There have been Batman movies I've loved and ones I've hated. There are some Batman movies my family and I quote and admire and others we make fun of while we re-watch them to revel in their captivating absurdity.

576,"Matt Reeves' long-awaited Batman reboot has in many ways become a magnificent, epic spectacle, with its dark, brooding version of Gotham, a pessimistic, haunted Batman as realized by Robert Pattinson, and an intricate, Zodiac inspired take on his main antagonist Riddler. But despite a relatively wide variation of themes and having the shell of a really good movie, The Batman slowly gets itself lost in sluggish power struggles, vapid social commentary, various allusions to original sin, and a promised showdown which turns out to be no more then a preface to the next episode of a prospective series. Pattinson's uninspired voice-over in the beginning and the end reveals that this Batman hasn't really learned anything or developed during the movie's far too indulgent running time, despite extensive soul-searching, ostensibly. He has just altered his justification for his actions. Not for the first time in Batman history, the villains are far more interesting than the hero. Paul Dano's wonderful performance makes Riddler a layered, fascinating specimen. And there are also delightful supporting work from Peter Sarsgaard as a tragic, corrupt district attorney, and an unrecognizable Colin Farrell as Penguin.",matt reev longawait batman reboot mani way becom magnific epic spectacl dark brood version gotham pessimist haunt batman realiz robert pattinson intric zodiac inspir take main antagonist riddler despit rel wide variat theme shell realli good movi batman slowli get lost sluggish power struggl vapid social commentari variou allus origin sin promis showdown turn prefac next episod prospect seri pattinson uninspir voiceov begin end reveal batman hasnt realli learn anyth develop movi far indulg run time despit extens soulsearch ostens alter justif action first time batman histori villain far interest hero paul dano wonder perform make riddler layer fascin specimen also delight support work peter sarsgaard tragic corrupt district attorney unrecogniz colin farrel penguin,neutral

Paul as the Riddler was just so haunting definitely the best villain in a DC movie since Heath Ledger in 2008.The score was also fantastic.

578,"With a gargantuan running time and a sluggish plot. The Batman promises more than it actually delivers.The opening broody act does whet the appetite. This is a dark, moody and nihilistic take on the Dark Knight. An adult take on the comic book with elements of horror.Director Matt Reeves is inspired by David Fincher. This is a grungy rain soaked world.With the Riddler, Penguin, Falcone and Catwoman. It soon descends into throwing everything in the hope that something sticks.There are too many characters and not enough action. There is a chase sequence featuring the Penguin and that is about it.Robert Pattinson is wasted. His stunt double might have well be in the Batsuit. As Bruce Wayne he looks like an emo waster with a drug problem rather than a rich spoilt brat.There were issues with the main villains as well. The Riddler is just another take on Heath Ledger's Joker who just wants to see the world burn or in this case the streets of Gotham flooded.As for the Penguin. What was the point in hiring Colin Farrell if he was going to be covered in latex and a fat suit.The biggest insult and this is where I sympathise with Alan Moore's criticism of Warner Brothers. Once again a global media conglomerate is peddling the line that society is in trouble. Police and politicians are corrupt.The answer is for everything to go down in flames. There is a scene where the new mayoress goes out to help people but is attacked in a scene that holds a mirror to the 2021 Capitol Hill attack.Batman states he will learn and will do his best to improve society rather than look for vengeance. The film then sows the seeds for the sequel with a clown that has the same attitude as the Riddler.This is from a company which only believes in one thing.

580,"We are now on ""The Batman."" I suppose such a title is to distinguish it from plain ol' ""Batman."" Like the football players who are from ""The"" Ohio State University or ""The"" University of Miami as though there are impostors of those same schools out there that they have to distinguish themselves from.Robert Pattinson plays Batman, and while his Batman is adequate, his Bruce Wayne was underwhelming. His Batman seemed to have fewer gadgets, but he did at least make his suit bulletproof. His Bruce Wayne was barely shown, and when he was it was as if he carried the pain and anger of Batman with him. All other Bruce Wayne's were able to turn on the charm when in public, this Bruce Wayne has the ""life sucks"" face.""The Batman"" opted to be more of a murder mystery than an action flick. There was action (even a scene involving the Penguin in which the audience applauded), but nothing like Batmans past.A glasses-wearing masked man was committing a string of murders. He was killing high profile members of Gotham and leaving cyphers for Batman to figure out. The movie doesn't hide that the killer is the Riddler, while it does hide his true identity. The Riddler was circuitously directing Batman and others to a particular criminal he wanted outed. Batman and Lt. James Gordon (Jeffrey Wright) suspected that the Riddler's final target was either The Penguin (Colin Farrell) or Carmine Falcone (John Turturro). Whether or not it's either of them is saved for close to the end.Speaking of the end, this movie was nearly three hours long, and I began to feel it. There was a point that the movie could've wrapped up, and I thought it was, then it dragged on for another half-hour or so. I was happy to be in the theater watching a movie, but not that happy. A two hour movie would've been just as satisfying. After watching all of the previews it made the movie-going experience well over three hours.How does this Batman stack up against the others? OK.

587,"The Batman is a con trying to pass sadism off as art. Marketing itself as a great procedural in the vein of the nineteen seventies cinema.The Batman is not even in the same league as the great Batman productions of the past. Let alone be compared to Chinatown, Taxi Driver or Klute as a great noir detective flick. Those films had real style and subtle dialogue that suited and ecplored a culture.The Batman is a bad procedural episode of Gotham meets Law & Order dressed up in a bat suit.Is the production design a watered down copy of Fincher's SEVEN, FIGHT CLUB and ZODIAK. Yes.Yet as a fully realized thought provoking film, The Batman is all dress up and posing.Take a bunch of noir movies most millennials never saw or have a clue about and compare them to The Batman..
The Batman is a cheap marketing ploy aimed at an international audience. One where Bang Bang, Crash, boom sells. The Batman is a terrible Batman film and only vaguely resembles Fincher in the most superficial of ways.To compare to Scorsese, John Huston or Polanski in his prime is joke and an amateurish attempt at relevance.Those three films make one realize what The Batman is not. It is not in the same league as those classic noir films. It is not authentic nor specific to a unique vision.It is more like GOTHAM, the TV show than a fully realized Major Motion Picture..
There are so many problems with this film in regards to carrying the torch of Bruce Wayne..
The film is more sadistic than dark. More inauthentic than creative. Just as the crimes are delivered with blunt force trauma, the film is ugly and lacks subtly..
It is a film school hack of Fincher's Seven
shoe horned over the Batman Franchise..
It was obviously made for an International market in the worst way. Dialogue is minimal because nuance of language does not translate or sell to foreign markets. Humor is non specific, because humor does not translate. There is zero humor in this film unless you find the visual ""Thumb-Drive"" funny, in that case you should see a psychologist..
Cinema needs to be specific and about a personal poi TGIF view to achieve an authentic tone..
The Batman is vague and lacks real nuance. This is what you get when you point to world market profits by trying to please as wide a market as possible, as opposed to making a great film. This is a new breed of foreign film geared for greed over the art of cinema..It is a package made for the largest burgeoning market, Asian markets, with its vast potential audience. That is all it is, a C poser version of something vaguely resembling a Batman film. Product exploiting Batman's marketing..
Villains and main characters have a lack of subtlety or character development. It is as if they were dropped in on us. The Riddler's name could be anything other than The Riddler. Gary perhaps. Psychotic Gary. His riddles are neither intriguing or intelligent. Yet the stupidest dolt in the theater can figure it out in seconds.These kind of villains are given titles of the Riddler or Joker, without earning the position. The drop in assuming we will rely on our preconceived knowledge. This makes the film lazy and incomplete..
I am sorry but vague moodiness, bad lighting and long slow plodding set pieces does not make it art..
It is boring, long on exposition for the sole purpose of moving plot without creating empathy for any character. There is no heart nor any real Batman DNA to care about..
It is all dress up with weak convictions and the worst car chase scene in the history of the bat mobile, if you could call it that..
Damn I hated this movie. I Am a huge Batman fan and this is easily a swing and a miss..
PS - Bob Kane's Batman goes all the way back to the 1930s. The 1950's & 1960s were a Golden Era of Batman comics. This Movie is a sullied, sadistic attempt to highjack the franchise as product. Purely a cynical money grab to exploit the franchise, especially in non-English speaking markets..

597,"Full Disclosure: I'm a huge Batman fan. I would say that the three movies by Christopher Nolan are probably my three favorite movies of all time, and that the three Arkham games are probably my three favorite videogames ever. So of course, I was extremely hyped for this movie, which also means that there was a big chance of me getting disappointed. And sadly, it was the case. Hopefully, it was just the hype, and my review will change after future viewings, which I think is really possible, especially after reading other reviews and seeing how most people loved it. But anyway, this is my review after watching the film for the first time:Being a big fan of detective thrillers, like Se7en and Prisoners, I was really on board with the tone and story The Batman was going for. Also, I liked the idea of a dark and realistic Batman but with a more ""comic book feel"" than the Bale movies. And even when the movie mostly succeeds in the tone, I thought it failed story wise.First, the movie tries too hard to develop too many characters and story lines, which makes it hard to stay invested on any of them. Sometimes, I felt that when I was finally getting intrigued by the Riddler storyline, the movie switched to focus on the Penguin or Falcone, and vice versa. In some ways, the movie makes the same mistakes Spiderman 3 did, introducing too many characters and storylines, interrupting you from getting griped.Second, even when we spent a ton of time with many characters, it feels like the movie doesn't spend enough with Bruce Wayne. I agree with not showing again the same origin story we´ve seen too many times but I think the movie should stay a little more time with Bruce Wayne, letting the audience get more attached to the character, so the movie can have a bigger emotional impact, even when he is dressed as Batman. Sadly, even being a 3-hour movie, The Batman, doesn't seem to spend enough time with its main character. In regards of Pattison's performance, I thought he was ok, but not even close to Bale.Finally, in what comes to the ending (no spoilers, but you can skip this part if you want to have no idea) the movie doesn't deliver the impactful finale that it seemed it was trying too hard preparing. The plot twist we were all waiting on the end, never comes, and the final battle is just Batman taking down some thugs, in a context that feels a bit over the top
In conclusion, The Batman could have been great, but sadly it isn't. The ""Se7en"" tone, the cast, and the cinematography got me hopping this would be the new Dark Knight. Unfortunately, the movie tries to do too much for just one movie, never letting you get totally invested, and leaving you with an ending that makes the whopping 3 hours feel not seem worth it.",full disclosur im huge batman fan would say three movi christoph nolan probabl three favorit movi time three arkham game probabl three favorit videogam ever cours extrem hype movi also mean big chanc get disappoint sadli case hope hype review chang futur view think realli possibl especi read review see peopl love anyway review watch film first timeb big fan detect thriller like seen prison realli board tone stori batman go also like idea dark realist batman comic book feel bale movi even movi mostli succe tone thought fail stori wisefirst movi tri hard develop mani charact stori line make hard stay invest sometim felt final get intrigu riddler storylin movi switch focu penguin falcon vice versa way movi make mistak spiderman introduc mani charact storylin interrupt get gripedsecond even spent ton time mani charact feel like movi doesnt spend enough bruce wayn agre show origin stori weve seen mani time think movi stay littl time bruce wayn let audienc get attach charact movi bigger emot impact even dress batman sadli even hour movi batman doesnt seem spend enough time main charact regard pattison perform thought ok even close balefin come end spoiler skip part want idea movi doesnt deliv impact final seem tri hard prepar plot twist wait end never come final battl batman take thug context feel bit top conclus batman could great sadli isnt seen tone cast cinematographi got hop would new dark knight unfortun movi tri much one movi never let get total invest leav end make whop hour feel seem worth,neutral

599,"Greetings again from the darkness. Riddle me this: does ""The Bat, The Cat, and The Rat"" sound more like an opening line to a joke or the title of a Dr. Seuss book? In fact, those are three core elements of this new, COVID-delayed, and highly anticipated film from writer-director Matt Reeves and co-writer Peter Craig. I'll confess to being a huge fan of Christopher Nolan's 'Dark Knight' trilogy (that concluded 10 years ago), and being a bit skeptical to a new version featuring Robert Pattinson in the titular role (I'm choosing to totally ignore the in-between portrayals in the ""Justice League"" movies). Knowing full well how important it is for fans to watch these films with fresh eyes and a clear head, this review is purposefully vague on what will surely prove to be some of the more popular and contentious discussion points.Let's start with a general description and the setup. The film is dark and gloomy and gritty and grimy. Gotham is a cesspool of corruption and crime, and we get no glimpse into the other side, assuming there is one. Billionaire Bruce Wayne (Robert Pattinson) is still in his second year as the Batman, often referred to as ""Vengeance"". There is substantial backstory for Mr. Wayne, who lives in relative seclusion with his trusty manservant Alfred Pennyworth (Andy Serkis), while the Batman prowls at night in his efforts to clean up the city. Of course he is unable to keep pace with crime and corruption, even with the close alliance he has built with good cop, Police Lt. James Gordon (Jeffrey Wright). It takes Batman's Poirot-like detective skills to solve a riddle left as a clue in a particularly high-profile murder case. Soon it's obvious a serial killer is at work and he has purposefully drawn the Batman into his game.The caped crusader proceeds to cross paths with Selena Kyle/Catwoman (a terrific Zoe Kravitz), Oswald Cobblepot/Penguin (an unrecognizable Colin Farrell), District Attorney Gil Golson (Peter Sarsgaard), and crime lord Carmine Falcone (John Turturro). As city VIPs begin showing up dead, it's a masked Edward Nashton/Riddler (Paul Dano) who always seems a step ahead. All of the above receive their chance to shine on screen, and while none let us down, it's not until the mask is ripped from Riddler, and Dano really shines, that we are left wanting more. It should be noted that Farrell (with his facial prosthetics and fat suit) is kind of a second fiddle here, but it's surely intentional and meant to set the stage for more Penguin antics down the road.Pattinson will certainly receive the most scrutiny. I found him to be an excellent Batman, with black eye makeup smeared by sweat under his cowl, maintaining the grungy tone. His whispery voice differs from Christian Bale's gravely growl, but works for the character's withdrawn nature and preference for detective work over than fighting. Staying true to the premise that this is only his second year, there is a significant shortage of ""wonderful toys"", and the batmobile is less rocket ship and more souped-up coupe. The contrast to these is a batsuit that seems quite advanced (and looks cool). It's Pattinson's Bruce Wayne that didn't work for me. I respect the reclusive billionaire aspect, but he mostly looks like someone on their way to a Nirvana gig, leaving us wondering how the heck could anyone not connect the dots between a creepy rich guy and a nearly identical creepy guy in a bat suit. It's a minor complaint, but one that stuck with me.Oscar-winning composer Michael Giacchino (UP, 2009) takes a more classical approach than the dramatics of predecessors Hans Zimmer and Danny Elfman. Giacchino has been a frequent Pixar contributor, and scored some well-known blockbusters in franchises like 'Jurassic World', 'Star Trek', 'Planet of the Apes', 'Mission Impossible', 'Spider-man', and 'Star Wars'. His work fits nicely here. Adapting characters and stories originated by Bob Kane and Bill Finger, Matt Reeves and Peter Craig have found a way to put their own stamp on the work. Mr. Craig is Oscar winner Sally Field's son, and his previous scripts include THE TOWN (2010), parts 1 and 2 of THE HUNGER GAMES: MOCKINGJAY, and upcoming high-profile projects in TOP GUN: MAVERICK and GLADIATOR 2. Director Reeves has previously helmed the excellent horror film LET ME IN (2010), as well as DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES (2014) and WAR FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES (2017).This marks the first in a planned Batman trilogy, and a couple of the last scenes seemingly set the stage for what's to come. Although this is an odd movie, here's hoping the franchise maintains this tone and avoids the typical Marvel/DC overblown CGI approach. After all, the Batman is but one man, not a God of superpowers. This film is an unusual blend of noir-horror-detective-action-psychological thriller wrapped in a gray box with a black bow, and though it will likely be divisive among fans (isn't everything?), this 3-hour epic leaves us anticipating the next 'bat time' and 'bat channel'.Opens wide in theaters on March 4, 2022.",greet dark riddl bat cat rat sound like open line joke titl dr seuss book fact three core element new coviddelay highli anticip film writerdirector matt reev cowrit peter craig ill confess huge fan christoph nolan dark knight trilog conclud year ago bit skeptic new version featur robert pattinson titular role im choos total ignor inbetween portray justic leagu movi know full well import fan watch film fresh eye clear head review purpos vagu sure prove popular contenti discus pointslet start gener descript setup film dark gloomi gritti grimi gotham cesspool corrupt crime get glimps side assum one billionair bruce wayn robert pattinson still second year batman often refer vengeanc substanti backstori mr wayn live rel seclus trusti manserv alfr pennyworth andi serki batman prowl night effort clean citi cours unabl keep pace crime corrupt even close allianc built good cop polic lt jame gordon jeffrey wright take batman poirotlik detect skill solv riddl left clue particularli highprofil murder case soon obviou serial killer work purpos drawn batman gameth cape crusad proce cross path selena kylecatwoman terrif zoe kravitz oswald cobblepotpenguin unrecogniz colin farrel district attorney gil golson peter sarsgaard crime lord carmin falcon john turturro citi vip begin show dead mask edward nashtonriddl paul dano alway seem step ahead receiv chanc shine screen none let u mask rip riddler dano realli shine left want note farrel facial prosthet fat suit kind second fiddl sure intent meant set stage penguin antic roadpattinson certainli receiv scrutini found excel batman black eye makeup smear sweat cowl maintain grungi tone whisperi voic differ christian bale grave growl work charact withdrawn natur prefer detect work fight stay true premis second year signific shortag wonder toy batmobil le rocket ship soupedup coup contrast batsuit seem quit advanc look cool pattinson bruce wayn didnt work respect reclus billionair aspect mostli look like someon way nirvana gig leav u wonder heck could anyon connect dot creepi rich guy nearli ident creepi guy bat suit minor complaint one stuck meoscarwin compos michael giacchino take classic approach dramat predecessor han zimmer danni elfman giacchino frequent pixar contributor score wellknown blockbust franchis like jurass world star trek planet ape mission imposs spiderman star war work fit nice adapt charact stori origin bob kane bill finger matt reev peter craig found way put stamp work mr craig oscar winner salli field son previou script includ town part hunger game mockingjay upcom highprofil project top gun maverick gladiat director reev previous helm excel horror film let well dawn planet ape war planet ape mark first plan batman trilog coupl last scene seemingli set stage what come although odd movi here hope franchis maintain tone avoid typic marveldc overblown cgi approach batman one man god superpow film unusu blend noirhorrordetectiveactionpsycholog thriller wrap gray box black bow though like divis among fan isnt everyth hour epic leav u anticip next bat time bat channelopen wide theater march,neutral

603,"""The Batman"" is a reboot of the titular DC superhero film franchise directed and co-written by Matt Reeves (""Cloverfield"", ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"", ""War for the Planet of the Apes""). Starring Robert Pattinson in the lead role as well as Zoe Kravitz, Paul Dano, and Colin Farrell, it is the best Batman film to grace our screens that doesn't feature any involvement from Christopher Nolan.Two years after adopting the vigilante alter ego of ""Batman"", the young reclusive billionaire Bruce Wayne (Robert Pattinson) is summoned by police lieutenant James Gordon (Jeffrey Wright) to help investigate the murder of Gotham City's mayor on Halloween night. Upon closer inspection, they soon learn that this killer referring to himself as ""The Riddler"" (Paul Dano) intends to kill more important political figures, leaving behind cryptic messages for Batman in the process. After deciphering some of the messages, Bruce discovers that the Riddler's motivation for these murders runs deeper than he had thought, to the point where it involves not only Gotham City's hidden crime syndicate, but also his own family's legacy.Do I really need to give a detailed introduction to someone like Batman? He's one of the most iconic superheroes of all time and everybody and their dog knows who he is. There have been many films made over the years that feature the Caped Crusader's escapades against criminals, from Tim Burton's Michael Keaton-led movies that took the character more seriously to Christopher Nolan's Christian Bale-led The Dark Knight Trilogy that are often ranked among the greatest superhero films ever made. Now with Matt Reeves' vision being brought to life in ""The Batman"", we have yet another fantastic depiction of this popular hero in an engaging film that embraces his detective roots.Many people seem to forget that in addition to fighting crime with his fists and high-tech gadgets, Batman is also an accomplished detective. His strategy of using stealth to sneak around for clues as well as his superior powers of deduction are rivalled only by the likes of Sherlock Holmes. Unfortunately, this quirk hasn't really been touched upon in past movies, instead focusing on the action-based aspects of the character, likely because most casual audiences would find these moments more fun to watch. That is, of course, until now.I loved how this film makes Batman's detective work the focal point of the story. He is more pragmatic in how he tries to unravel the mystery of the Riddler's crimes, only using brute force when absolutely necessary. With that in mind, the film has clearly taken influence from the detective noir movies of many decades ago, like ""Chinatown"" and ""The French Connection"". Like those two examples, this one doesn't focus much on action but rather the main character's intellect to solve such an enigmatic puzzle. Personally, I enjoyed seeing this otherwise glanced-over character trait of Batman but I can understand why some audiences might not think the same way. As previously mentioned, there isn't as much action here as in other Batman films so I imagine there may be complaints from those who want more scenes of hand-to-hand combat.Another similarity this film has to classic noir fiction is its wonderful cinematography. There are many memorable shots that show Batman silhouetted among the skyline of Gotham City, often complimented by a beautiful colour palette to help him stand out. Noir does literally mean ""Black"" in French after all so this certainly fits a character like Batman to a tee. There's one scene that takes place almost entirely in the dark and the only form of light illuminating the characters is the gunfire. What would normally be difficult to see, given the circumstances, is made much more comprehensible thanks to Matt Reeves' slick direction. Reeves makes it clear that Gotham is rife with corruption and crime, emphasising this by showing how nobody is without sin. Though Bruce is a morally upstanding citizen, he too has skeletons in his closet regarding his family history. Likewise, even certain members of the police department are shown to have some ties to the criminal underworld.With all of these story elements coming together, it should be no surprise that there is a lot of ground to be covered. Because of this, the film ends up clocking in at just under three hours in length (176 minutes to be precise). Again, because of Matt Reeves' solid directing, by some miracle, he manages to make it all work so harmoniously within the given timeframe. The severity of the Riddler's murders taking place all over Gotham City actually aids in giving the film sufficient world building. We see a nightclub run by the local mafia, politicians lying about repairing what urgently needs to be fixed, and the media manipulating facts as a means to bring in ratings. As a result, Gotham feels like an actual location inhabited by real people, not simply because it has used obvious New York City landmarks as its basis (e.g. The Gotham State Building instead of the Empire State Building), but because they all echo true to the real world which can be just as much of a hellish place as something conceived in fiction, perhaps even more so.In addition to this, the Batman movies are also known for their unforgettable soundtracks. Tim Burton's films were complimented by Danny Elfman's energetic musical score while Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight Trilogy benefited strongly from Hans Zimmer's grandiose use of horns and drums. It seems we can now add Michael Giacchino's dark, brooding music to the list of memorable Batman scores that many will remember years from now. The main theme definitely suits the film's despondent tone, complete with downbeat piano notes, giving it a haunting feeling that all is lost. I also liked how the film used Nirvana's ""Something In The Way"" to convey what is going through Bruce Wayne's mind. Its lyrics are a metaphor for being isolated from the rest of society, which is of course highly appropriate when considering Bruce's reclusive nature.There's no other working actor right now who could have played this particular incarnation of the Dark Knight better than Robert Pattinson (or ""Battinson"" if you will). Hopefully he can finally shed the shackles of that stigma he had being associated with the Twilight series since he now has this role to be proud of instead. Pattinson depicts Bruce Wayne as a deeply insecure man who is still reeling from the trauma of losing both his parents, and this is reflected in some of his inexperience when donning the superhero uniform. Usually whenever we see the Batman/Bruce Wayne dynamic, we are only ever shown Bruce's morose personality juxtaposed with Batman's one-track minded determination. Here, the lines are blurred as at times we can see some of Bruce's personal feelings getting in the way of his decision making as Batman. This presents an interesting point of vulnerability in the character that we don't tend to see, which makes him easier for the audience to identify with.Zoe Kravitz is also great as Selena Kyle/Catwoman. I've always enjoyed watching Catwoman's interactions with Batman throughout various forms of media and the ones in this film rank up there among the very best. The two have such believable chemistry since she is neither truly evil nor good, essentially making her an ideal grey area character. Despite being of different social classes, Kyle's downtrodden worldview resonates strongly with Bruce's equally pessimistic vision for the future of Gotham City. Naturally this leads to some great ""will they or won't they"" scenes that help bring a spark of hope that things could turn out for the better if they both worked together, but other matters always seem to prevent them from moving forward.As the film's main antagonist, Paul Dano puts his own intriguing spin on The Riddler. Instead of a man dressed in green wearing a hat with a question mark, Dano's Riddler is draped in a large poncho-like outfit and a mask that obscures his entire face. He is an intimidating figure who always seems to be at least five steps ahead of Batman and the police department. The riddles he leaves behind at the crime scenes are akin to that of the real-life Zodiac Killer, with complex patterns and codes that are hard to decipher at first glance. It was a clever idea to make allusions to that infamous murderer, especially since the mystery of who the Zodiac Killer really was remains unsolved to this day.Also playing an important role in the film is Colin Farrell as Oswald Cobblepot/The Penguin. Like Batman himself, this version of The Penguin is still relatively inexperienced when compared to most other depictions in movies and TV shows. Farrell is completely unrecognisable in his makeup, so much so that I kept on forgetting it was him playing the character. I cannot discuss his significance in the story too much since that would give away important spoilers so all I will say is that he leaves just as much of an impression as the Riddler.Considering the high quality of its three predecessors, ""The Batman"" definitely had a lot to live up to in the wake they have left behind. What helped it achieve this with flying colours was the atypical direction it took things in. By primarily harkening back to its detective-focused origins, we have something that works both as a superhero film and a neo-noir film all rolled into one. On top of that, we also have a unique portrayal of the main character by Robert Pattinson to solidify the film's legacy as one of the best in the entire franchise. According to Matt Reeves, there are sequels confirmed to be on the way so if he is able to recapture lightning in a bottle, then exciting times lie ahead.I rate it a solid 9/10.",batman reboot titular

604,"5 out of 5 stars.The Batman is an electrifying dark superhero film and dives into an psychological crime story. Director Matt Reeves takes this film into a whole new dark direction. So dark that every scene seems faded or taking place in a night raining setting. The script and narration in the beginning sets the tone of the film. With Bruce Wayne giving a narrative about how he brings fear that every criminal stays away from the shadows. The film is one awesome superhero film. Watching it the first time may not be enough with so much to digest on what is going on with the depth layer of the story. For a 3 hour run time, the film packs so much that it never once felt long.The script and direction is great. Dark atmospheric setting. Showing Gotham a city that is on a ticking time bomb with crime happening. Nirvana's song playing a couple of times setting that mood of the film. Which is dark and setting that depressing mood. But it works great. The action sequences are great. The fight scenes are well choregraphed. The villains Riddler played by Paul Dano is great. Riddler played more like a zodiac killer. The direction plays like a crime solving film with Batman being detective and on the trail of the riddler. Leading Batman investigating criminal syndicates like Falcone (John Turturro) and Penguin (Colin Farrell). And catwoman (Zoe Kravitz) assisting him with the investigation. The film gritty and grounded with its action sequences. The car chase was awesome with the cinematography being close to the action as possible.Robert Pattinson is great as a dark version of Bruce Wayne. And great as Batman. Paul Dano is good. John Turturro, Colin Farrell, Zoe Kravitz, Andy Serkis, and Jeffrey Wright were all great with there roles.The cinematography and music score were great. The film does have one brief scene that hints towards another film. The film has a deep depth story that packs a lot and ties a lot together.

606,"If you like the Marvel recipe for how to make a movie well then you're going to hate this one. Bright, colorful, poses, humor every 15 minutes, lame over the top scene after scene... yeah not in The Batman. This was more of a drama than action film. It had more in common with a suspense movie than a superhero movie. It reminded me of The Joker movie. The 3 hours went by fast for me. At one point it did drag a little but the pacing is really good so I got sucked right back in. Shout out to Paul Dano. His acting was amazing. He was so unnerving. His delivery of his lines was superb. His eyes you could see his anger his pain. Such a good performance. Everyone else was good too. I enjoyed the entire cast but Riddler stole the show. The movie is so well made. The Dark Knight was a better movie but The Batman was a better portrayal of Batman. They showed his anger, his depression and how he is consumed with his parents death and what that would actually look like. It comes off as emo Batman but that's who he would actually be. So I don't mind it. If you're that consumed by your past it shows in the present and it did. My only complaint is the same one I have with every Batman film. They downgrade Batman and have to make him as realistic as possible. I wish they would make him like he is in the comics. In the movie he's smart not brilliant. He's a good fighter but not amazing. For example his cape is just for show, he uses a squirrel suit to soar around which yeah is realistic but I'd rather him just use his cape. Does it make sense with reality? No, the squirrel suit makes sense. BUT he's not realistic. He's near perfect with ridiculous gadgets and I'd like to see that. We're okay with wonder woman reflecting bullets, superman being well superman, ironman flying around at jet speed shooting pulse cannons, thor being a GOD BUT Batman yeah he has to be realistic. Literally his cape doesn't do anything because that's not realistic enough for it to have purpose so let's give him a squirrel suit lol! Meanwhile every other superhero is so unbelievable but every Batman movie they're like how do we show he's just a man? But hes not just a man he's insanely over the top and I wish they'd portray him as such just one time. Okay my rant is over.

609,"Is anyone surprised this was coming? For years, the comic book nerds have groused about a) why Bruce Wayne isn't so troubled by the death of his parents b) he doesn't do any detective workSo we get Emo Batman. Sunk deep into bleak variations on grunge pop Nirvana's ""Something In The Way"" it draws a doom and gloom march towards the unveiling of a serial killer in Gotham City. There are also nods to ""Seven"" & ""The Crow"" two films that have constant rain and a dark presence hovering over its dirty city.Some of the details of the Wayne's history is baffling. Perhaps I've not read the comics those are based on. Particularly his Father past nor his Mother's, which implies a Kennedy connection there, in terms of wealthy people burying their shame. Regardless of the attempt to clean up some of the darkness that haunts the Wayne family, none of their justification by way of Alfred (Andy Serkis) doesn't absolve guilt in any way. Which leaves you feeling off-put by our perception of what certain people meant to the city. In some ways, the movie actually asks you to forgive.For the most part, Robert Pattinson does very well when he dons the cowl. Once out, he seems to be a reject from The Cure. Much like Brandon Lee. His dead eyes match his dead soul. And director Matt Reeves is decisive when it comes to not showing the joys of wealth. A point which is made when we find out why the Riddler exists.Paul Dano does well as the Riddler. Though doesn't stray too far from Heath Ledger's Joker. Which is a shame. At a certain point, they could be interchangeable. A flaw I've always seen with both characters. And Colin Ferrell's Penguin bellows wildly like Robert DeNiro's Al Capone in ""The Untouchables (1987). A very easy connection. Even looks like him.I felt Zoe Kravitz as Catwoman was a massive misstep. She seems to be cut-and-paste here. Something is missing in her performance that separates all the other ones. A sexuality that oozes through the screen. Like every story prior to this has her story changed but she still is alluring. Kravitz does not have that quality. Many moments of sexual innuendos to be mined, but fall flat due to Hollywood's lack of courage to just make a fun movie that have Batman and Catwoman flirt. This doesn't want that. So what is their attraction? One wonders.All in all, children will not get this Batman police procedural. It's coming at an angle where it may be a long t.v.series, but doesn't have the sense of comic book quality the predecessors had to make it a cinematic adventure.I do like they went with something different. And perhaps this is what is lacking for me. For others, it may be a refreshing change of pace from the wildly comical Batmans. I just think this bleakness gives one very little interest in future installments by the same team.",anyon surpris come year comic book nerd grous bruce wayn isnt troubl death parent b doesnt detect workso get emo batman sunk deep bleak variat grung pop nirvana someth way draw doom gloom march toward unveil serial killer gotham citi also nod seven crow two film constant rain dark presenc hover dirti citysom detail wayn histori baffl perhap ive read comic base particularli father past mother impli kennedi connect term wealthi peopl buri shame regardless attempt clean dark haunt wayn famili none justif way alfr andi serki doesnt absolv guilt way leav feel offput percept certain peopl meant citi way movi actual ask forgivefor part robert pattinson well don cowl seem reject cure much like brandon lee dead eye match dead soul director matt reev decis come show joy wealth point made find riddler existspaul dano well riddler though doesnt stray far heath ledger joker shame certain point could interchang flaw ive alway seen charact colin ferrel penguin bellow wildli like robert deniro al capon untouch easi connect even look like himi felt zoe kravitz catwoman massiv misstep seem cutandpast someth miss perform separ one sexual ooz screen like everi stori prior stori chang still allur kravitz qualiti mani moment sexual innuendo mine fall flat due hollywood lack courag make fun movi batman catwoman flirt doesnt want attract one wondersal child get batman polic procedur come angl may long tvseri doesnt sen comic book qualiti predecessor make cinemat adventurei like went someth differ perhap lack other may refresh chang pace wildli comic batman think bleak give one littl interest futur instal team,neutral

611,"There are so many Batman movies now. So many styles, so many expectations and standards. The Batman is successful at the outset when it comes to establishing its own style, tone and momentum.It's dark (literally and psychologically), patient, intriguing and draws you in. The look is pretty unique, like a 1940s film noir crossed with gothic architecture from centuries ago, but also with the feel of a modern crime thriller.The Riddler is an interesting villain. Like a serial killer. The clues are exciting since they give us little bits of information and make us want more. We get to see Batman as a detective, a puzzle solver. I became quite excited about where the film would head. With its long running time, my hopes were high.However, it loses steam about halfway through. First of all, the Riddler's motivations suddenly switch. Initially he was targeting corrupt people and exposing the truth. Okay, maybe he's too extreme (killing a torturing) but at least he's hurting bad people. Maybe he will work with Batman! And how far do the lies go? This is becoming big.But then the Riddler kills civilians, seemingly indifferently. And he claims to be inspired by Batman. But Batman only beats up thugs, not random people. And how did Riddler's henchmen know that he calls himself ""vengeance""?It makes no sense for the Riddler to allow himself to get caught. What was the purpose? Okay, it's cute that it was all ""part of the plan"", but why? Think about it and it falls apart.The music. My goodness. It completely sucks. Giacchino cannot write for live action movies. I don't know why. The Incredibles? Great. Up and Inside Out? Very nice. But The Batman? Just, utter crap. Boring, plodding, repetitive, by-the-numbers. Especially compared to the work of Zimmer and Elfman, it's terrible. And it ruins many moments which could have been quite good.Catwoman has some awful lines. References to ""white privilege"" (why was race relevant?) and ""CEO hedge fund types"". What's wrong with CEOs? They help manage massive corporations which sustain thousands of jobs and satisfy millions of customers. If it's so easy, why doesn't she do it? As for hedge funds, many middle class people have money indirectly invested in them. It's simply a mechanism for managing risks in a large, complicated economy. There are wins and losses, but no stealing. They help accommodate entrepreneurs by spreading risks. But who cares about that when you can just hate ""the rich""?Matt Reeves really misses the mark in terms of his overall message. The start works because it's brooding and shows Batman successfully intimidating bad guys. They even fear the shadows - how great is that! But later he implies that Bruce should be doing more for charity, that beating up thugs doesn't work. Why? Because the script says so and Reeves' politics say so.We start getting long, unnecessary shots of Batman walking. The movie drags on. The Riddler is no longer interesting but just some lonely killer with no real plan or insight. He's a loser. The Joker has a lame and unnecessary cameo. The final shot is horrible as Catwoman drives away - but who cares? The connection with Batman feels artificial and her leaving carries no weight.Farrell is good as Penguin, but unrecognisable. In the end though, his character doesn't really change the path of the movie much at all. It's exciting at first, but pointless once you think about it.Batman should have died 3 or 4 times at least, from explosions, falling, getting shot, etc. There are no stakes - he's immortal, along with Alfred and the mayor. What's the point if nobody can die? Is everyone using rubber bullets or something?Nolan's trilogy remains the benchmark for Batman and superhero movies in general. In fact, for action, crime thrillers in general. The Batman had much promise, but it needed to grow up and follow through with its concept. Make the Riddler intelligent, give Batman something to risk, embrace who the Batman is rather than trying to deconstruct him, have characters defined by choices rather than skin colour.

612,"I don't believe it's worth 8.4 rating. I'll admit I was not a fan of Pattinson to begin but optimistic about the writers and directors being confident and me being a real cinema enthusiast. It showcases Pattinson and his (one-trick resume) acting style. The characters and most acting was great. Oswald, Riddler, Gordon, Catwoman were all good adaptations. I wish some of the of the lines were more thought out and not corny. Like how I wish Gordon was more defensive for his new Batman, just in making his fellow co-workers to appreciate what they are trying to do. Also, the way ""the Bat"" talks to Alfred was just kind of angry/careless, it seemed like a scared kid that was hardly even becoming a man. I just didn't see it as necessary or at least could've been written differently. I also thought maybe we would have him truly a body transformation and lift weights, if we were going the way of a angry/vengeful young Hero. The movie could've easily had 35 minutes cut out. Some of the Riddlers rantings just seemed too much and tiring. I would've liked to see more action in all because there really was not many good sequences with gadgets or batmobile type action. Colin Farrell is a way under-rated actor, and Paul Dano was great. Overall I was not impressed, and since we had to postpone again and again and then raise the movie theatre prices just for this, ""the Batman"" movie. Maybe they're just pushing for new standard fees with all this covid nonsense and inflation is a good excuse I suppose. Understanding people like myself will continue to pay but there is a point that will end the movie theatre experience for a lot of people I feel. Anyways, if this is just the start to the new franchise, I won't be in line for the next one. I hope it works out for the newer generation that does not know much about the former films. Not my favorite Batman but a decent movie. I would not add to my collection with a 3hr run time.

614,"The Batman feels like the definitive take on the titular caped crusader. A sprawling, dark and epic story that finally puts Batman's detective skills front and centre whilst having ample commentary on today's society.Robert Pattinson gives a perfect lead performance as Bruce Wayne/Batman that's different to what's come before. A Bruce Wayne who only lives to be Batman and carries a visible pain and trauma in every scene. He also manages to do so much with so little, able to convey a lot with just a simple look or turn.Zoë Kravitz is an excellent Catwoman with her own pain and history and has all the necessary charisma and style. Paul Dano is an absolutely terrifying Riddler, having plenty of unsettling and loud outbursts of rage skillfully counterbalanced with quiet whispers.Also notable performances include an unrecognisable Colin Farrell, Jeffrey Wright, who is a superb Gordon and surprisingly active. Andy Serkis' Alfred, who manages to do a lot with a little and John Turturro who is icily cold and satisfyingly restrained as Carmine Falcone.Matt Reeves' direction is incredible, Gotham is at its most fully realized with a nice balance of realism and comic book extravagance. Action sequences are all extremely unique and are therefore able to standout with the car chase in particular being an unforgettable set piece.The pacing is also perfect, able to make it's three hour runtime fly by due to something always happening without feeling rushed. The music by Michael Giacchino is instantly iconic.

618,"*Major Spoilers*Aesthetics & Environment:
The aesthetics of Gotham are captured nicely, but very grounded. Basically how would Gotham look like today - with large advertising billboards etc. Scenes capture the gloominess of Gotham nicely. Rainy. Dark. Grey.Batman Myth and Lore Setting:
The myth of Batman is set-up very nicely. 'I don't own the shadows, I am the shadow' - nice. Criminals thinking that Batman is hiding in every shadow. The heavy footsteps of Batman approaching. That gives you genuine fear for what may come from the shadows.Comic Accuracy:
Basically 2/10. Pattinson may be a good Batman but he is NOT a good Bruce Wayne. He kept reminding me of some emo dude who's now Batman. I have watched Batman: Year One, and this Year Two Batman was not even close. Not for once did Pattinson reminded me of Bruce Wayne.Nothing beats Affleck as Bruce Wayne (both the tortured one from BvS, and optimistic one from ZSJL). I repeat, nothing beats Affleck!As for being Batman. I overall liked him. But I will cover that later below in detail.Same goes with other characters. Selina Kyle. Falcone. The Riddler (I cover that later too). Gordon. None of these characters reminded me of who they were supposed to be, even if they are early in their character arcs.Collin Farrell's Oswald Cobblepot is right on the money though. I missed his trick umbrella. But given the grounded nature of the movie, I'll let it go. Lol.The Protagonist:
Pattinson is a good Batman overall. BUT with some huge comic inaccuracies.As I earlier said that the movie is very grounded overall, but still. Batman using an actual realistic wingsuit rather than his cape was the biggest goof for me, and WAY TOO realistic. Even Nolanverse was able to work out cape-flying.This Batman is a recluse. So no strong Wayne Enterprises dynamics in his character either. He's more of a loner guy doing recon on his own, undercover. There is minimal tactical help from Alfred to him. No mission comms between the two either.There were some hits and some misses with this Batman.The Antagonist(s):
Riddler as a standalone serial killer nails it. Is he the Riddler from comics? No. Not really. This is inside the mind of a deranged serial killer, hell bent on delivering his version of justice.Is he scary? 100%. Loved his performance. It really gets under your skin. Genuinely scared the hell out of me in some of the scenes. Especially the opening first one.Oswald Cobblepot is another bullseye. Loved how comic accurate he was. Loved his accent.Carmine Falcone, eh not so much. Didn't look like a mob boss. Bad casting choice, I'd say.Other Characters:
James Gordon is criminally ignored to develop as a character. He remains a static one-dimensional character from beginning till the end. The acting was superb, but his character didn't get much attention it seemed.Same goes with Alfred. There's hardly any dynamics between Alfred & Bruce, or Alfred & Batman. Is Bruce devastated when Alfred is attacked? Yes, obviously. But before that, we hardly see them operating as a duo.The Plot/Story:
It's a detective story at heart. Do NOT expect a lot of action or lengthy hand-to-hand combat sequences (like Batman vs Bane from TDKR, or Warehouse Fight scene from BvS). You have basically seen all the fight sequences in the trailer already. Those are all. It's also a slow burn, with a somewhat explosive third-act.Plot unfolds in a decent pace. It doesn't seemed rushed. Somewhat slow at some points. This allows for good character development. With a few exceptions, mostly characters develop nicely throughout the story.The narrative itself and the parable is highly political in nature. In a nutshell, this-
""Present Day Left America (represented by Batman, Selina & Gordon) trying to save Gotham (representing USA) from Present-Day Right America (represented by Riddler); who is hell bent on delivering his own deranged definition of justice. Mainly triggered because of 'The Sins of their Father' - Orphanage Renewal, Thomas & Martha Wayne's controversial past (representing USA's dark past: slavery etc).""But I'd leave that for your own interpretation :)Cinematography:
Some beautiful and mind-blowing scenes. One of the strongest aspect of this film. The noir is perfectly done.Car chase scene is so superbly done that you can't help but appreciate it. Batmobile kills it. Very ground, but very destructive. You could feel its actual power.The 44 Below scene which takes place in gunshot flashes. OMFG! Although seemed inspired by The Dark Knight Returns (animated) and The Dark Knight Rises (Live Action), but this was the perfect rendition of that scene.Sound and Music:
Sound design is okay. At some points it's nicely done (like car chase), at some points it's weak (Batman's punches felt weaker, even from the trailer). There were NO bone-cracking sounds with his punches.No memorable soundtrack. At some points the soundtrack even seems so generic. Not a strong OST; like those composed by Hans Zimmer or JunkieXL in the past.To Wrap up:
7 / 10
It hits somewhere perfectly. It misses somewhere. It's a good Batman in its own right. But cannot work with DCEU, neither is it very comic accurate. Think of it as Joker (movie). Very much standalone. And very very different - and not in a bad way!

624,"Out of the deep dark depths of Gotham City comes the newest addition to one of the best-known franchises. The Batman, starring Robert Pattinson is thrilling, chilling, and jam-packed with action. We all know and love Batman, but this stellar cast will show you a deeper, darker side of him and other characters who have been loved, and hated, for generations.The Batman is an exciting addition to the DC Universe, but does not follow the original Dark Knight trilogy. This new film follows beloved hero, Batman, as he tracks down a series of murders of Gotham's most powerful people. He is given clues written in cryptic codes that he has to decipher, all while the deviously smart (and insane) Riddler (Paul Dano) is killing off important people one by one. From a history of lies, in a corrupt city, and in a battle over the true meaning of justice comes the new DC film that will get in your mind and stay there.From the moment the lights of the theater dimmed and the movie started, I was hooked. I have never been a fan of movies that waste time getting to the meat of the story, and The Batman wastes no time. This film is full of suspense, and the music is one of the major components that contributes to that. In intense situations, atmosphere is everything, and the music by Oscar-winning composer Michael Giacchino creates the perfect amount of eeriness and tension. Robert Pattinson's acting is also incredible. This Batman speaks very little, but his body language and facial expressions speak volumes. I was extremely impressed by how real and broken Pattison makes his character seem, and I have never seen this protagonist reach depths like this in other Batman stories. The one thing in this movie I would have liked to see more of is the story behind Batman's technology. He seems to have a million gadgets, but the audience doesn't know exactly what they are or where they came from.The message of this film is that vengeance won't change the past, but helping others can change the future. A big part of this film is about justice and what that means. In the end, we see that justice isn't about killing or hurting others. Justice is about taking what is wrong and fixing it by doing the right thing. Justice does not equal bloody revenge.I give The Batman 5 out of 5 stars, and I recommend it to ages 13 to 17, plus adults. You can see The Batman in theatres on March 4, 2022.

628,"This is such a cool take on Batman.After hypermasculine and overly serious Bale and Affleck I think many people have lost sight of how WEIRD Batman is- a millioner who spends most of his time running around the city in a tight suit and/or in his bat(?!)cave plannig the next mission/new gadgets.Playboying? Getting swole? In this day and age?Nah, give me anti-social emo weirdo with unprocessed emotional trauma.I am also VERY biased when it comes to BatCat, and once again where Christian and Anne were very polished and coy Robert and Zoe are much more, idk, layered?

631,"I will start with the positives. This movie was beautifully made with amazing camera shots and much more when it comes to lighting, tone, etc. All the creepy shots through glass and binoculars really complimented the detective style story they went for. The construction of what Gotham should look like was amazing in this film. The cast was great with Rob playing batman really well and Zoey as catwoman. Colin Farrell was by far gave the best performance in my opinion. Dano's masked portion was insane and sinister. The score was great for the most part. I really enjoyed the nitty gritty and borderline R rated scenes. I loved how the training and pre-batman stage was excluded because we all know how that story goes. The use of sound was outstanding especially for the action sequences the punches really hit hard and the explosions really shake you. Every fighting sequence you felt the anger and rage that batman displays. The scene with batman walking towards the penguin in the turned over car actually gave me goosebumps.Now to the negatives I felt really held this movie back. NOT ENOUGH ANDY SERKIS. I know its not called The Butler but come on I wish there was more Andy. The interactions between batman and catwoman were a bit weird at sometimes and I never really felt the love connection they were suppose to be building through the film and when they kissed it seemed misplaced because there was no real chemistry built toward it. Rob's batman was great but the Bruce Wayne billionaire playboy character was non-existent and he looked like a emo teenager. Dano's acting towards the end felt like he was reaching a little and I am not sure if that's on his own accord or the directing. The movie felt way too long because of the almost slow motion scenes where they are grabbing something too slow or walking too slow and that was throughout the film so of course it will stack. The third act had moments where the movie felt it was wrapping up but didn't. I do not care if a movie is long but for some reason I caught myself a couple times checking the time. Dialogue was being muttered at some points and was hard to understand. Not every scene has to be a hush hush moment. I know in the end Batman saved the mayor and most of the people but the city is destroyed!I think this film was amazing made and the story up until about halfway was great but it felt a tad dragged out.

633,"Individually, there's nothing that necessarily stands out as downright terrible, though the score/sound design/music (let's just call all that ""sound "" from here out) comes very, very close, but even if falls into that category, that alone shouldn't result in such a boring, bland movie, but here we are...The cinematography is good, the acting is acceptable. The script isn't even necessarily bad, but everything combined together somehow results in a movie that is borderline unwatchable despite its huge budget, great visuals, costume design, strong cast, etc.You'll be able to tell if you're going to like this movie (and agree with my review) in the first 10 minutes as it's immediately apparent throughout the first scenes that the director has utterly failed in his endeavor to create a ""dark, film noir.""In The Batman, the opening scenes are trying so very hard to be ""grisly and menacing"" but the lack of atmosphere is so pronounced you feel as if you're watching a post-production rough edit that's yet to receive the final touches from sound...For a reminder of how important sound is to a movie, consider the opening scene of Blade Runner 2049 vs The Batman. The sound design immediately sucks you into the Blade Runner world and the opening scene, score, and landscape gives a sense of the grandiose scope of the movie, but in The Batman there's nothing gives you that grand feeling of a ""cinematic"" event or ""world building"" which is actually quite a remarkable feat given the scope of the project.As for the music...The Batman was surely hoping for a result similar to The Crow and how its music played as big a role as the actors and set in terms of creating the mood.As you sit and hear the familiar chords of Nirvana's ""Something in the Way"" come in with the ""grisly"" scene that's in front you you, your mind tells you, this should be an absolutely amazing, perfect song for this moment.However, it so misses the mark that it's actually jarring. The fact that this feels so completely hollow and soulless despite the context of everything going on only shines a bright spotlight on the fact that this movie's main problem is that it feels utterly soulless.You realize the inclusion of the song is merely a desperate attempt to score ""cool"" points and appeal to nostalgia rather than part of an artistic vision or moment created by the director/film.In essence, it feels like your parents turning up the car stereo to your favorite song and singing along.And it's this moment that made it clear. This is simply a big budget generic ""film noir"" that's been pieced together by people (mainly director) who might be technically proficient but completely devoid any ""artistic"" vision and movie making ""magic.""This emotional vacuum plagues the entire movie and is perhaps perfectly personified by Pattinson's performance.I wouldn't even call his performance inherently bad. His somewhat ""flat"" delivery was assuredly 100% intentional, but the ""movie making"" of everyone else (esp. The director, Matt Reeves) is simply not good enough to create the setting for such a performance to come off correctly...This is a remarkable feat for anyone who's seen Pattison's recent work and has likely been impressed with how natural and captivating his recent performances have been UNDER GOOD DIRECTION (notably The King, Good Time, The Lighthouse, etc). Given good direction and moving making I believe there could have been a utterly amazing movie and performance.Finally, to end with a simple summary.... I don't know that this movie will be enjoyable for anyone who isn't a hardcore Batman/DC fanboy.",individu there noth necessarili stand downright terribl though scoresound designmus let call sound come close even fall categori alon shouldnt result bore bland movi areth cinematographi good act accept script isnt even necessarili bad everyth combin togeth somehow result movi borderlin unwatch despit huge budget great visual costum design strong cast etcyoul abl tell your go like movi agre review first minut immedi appar throughout first scene director utterli fail endeavor creat dark film noirin batman open scene tri hard grisli menac lack atmospher pronounc feel your watch postproduct rough edit that yet receiv final touch soundfor remind import sound movi consid open scene blade runner v batman sound design immedi suck blade runner world open scene score landscap give sen grandios scope movi batman there noth give grand feel cinemat event world build actual quit remark feat given scope projecta musicth batman sure hope result similar crow music play big role actor set term creat mooda sit hear familiar chord nirvana someth way come grisli scene that front mind tell absolut amaz perfect song momenthowev miss mark actual jar fact feel complet hollow soulless despit context everyth go shine bright spotlight fact movi main problem feel utterli soullessy realiz inclus song mere desper attempt score cool point appeal nostalgia rather part artist vision moment creat directorfilmin essenc feel like parent turn car stereo favorit song sing alongand moment made clear simpli big budget gener film noir that piec togeth peopl mainli director might technic profici complet devoid artist vision movi make magicthi emot vacuum plagu entir movi perhap perfectli personifi pattinson performancei wouldnt even call perform inher bad somewhat flat deliveri assuredli intent movi make everyon el esp director matt reev simpli good enough creat set perform come correctlythi remark feat anyon who seen pattison recent work like impress natur captiv recent perform good direct notabl king good time lighthous etc given good direct move make believ could utterli amaz movi performancefin end simpl summari dont know movi enjoy anyon isnt hardcor batmandc fanboy,positive

Batman has been brought to the big screen several times: Tim Burton's great ""Batman"" (1989) and ""Batman Returns"" (1992) were a tribute to the comic book style. Then came Christopher Nolan's trilogy with plots more focused on neo-noir and with a darker comic style. This 2022, Matt Reeves launches his vision of the bat, ""The Batman"", with an intriguing script that mixes neo-noir and psychological thriller. The work of the cinematographer is of a higher level, the camera movements are daring and that dark, quite gothic atmosphere is captivating. The soundtrack is incredible, as well as a great job by the sound department.

639,"'The Batman' gives us 6th film-version of Bruce Wayne in Robert Pattinson and a lot of people are asking ""do we need another Batman film?"" After watching this, the answer is ""yes"". From the director of the last two (great) 'Planet of the Apes' films, this is a brooding and dark, true-to-form Batman film, much closer to Tim Burton's films than the Snyder & Schumacher films. It has some aspects in similar with the Nolan trilogy, but is different enough to stand alone.This is a younger Batman/Bruce, and does well to not re-tell the story of his parents' deaths. Essential to any good Batman film is a good Alfred and Serkis is great. The entire cast is really good - Selina (Kravitz), Lieutenant Gordon (Wright), the Riddler (Dano), Falcone (Turturro) and Oswald/Penguin (Farrell) - who is literally unrecognisable in his make-up. Dano brings a great energy to the Riddler and makes him seem realistic in the world we live in - definitely no trace of Jim Carey here! The scenes with Bruce & Selina work really well.While this is very dark, both visually and thematically - including the repeated use of Nirvana's 'Something in the Way' - it really suits the noir vibe of the mystery that has Bruce & Gordon trying to solve the Riddler's puzzles/murders. They make Gotham very believable - always raining - and there's a great car chase scene, as well as plenty of realistic hand-to-hand combat. While it's long - almost 3 hours - it doesn't drag and the pacing is good, with the non-action components being as exciting as the fight scenes.

641,"Someone is killing off senior political leaders in Gotham: the major, the chief of police, the district attorney. At the scene of each murder is found a note to Batman with a riddle and a clue to what is behind the murders. Batman's investigations lead him to a conspiracy that stretches back to when his father, Thomas Wayne, ran for mayor and, shortly after, was murdered.When this movie was first released I didn't have much regard for it. Superhero movies are dime-a-dozen and generally lacklustre, being all style and no substance. To make things worse, Batman is played by Robert Pattinson, an individual with no discernible acting talent and star of the massive pile of excrement that is Twilight.Now that I've watched it I must say I am very pleasantly surprised. Rather than consisting of mindless action scenes and no plot, this film is one of substance. The plot is clever and quite solid, resembling more of a detective/mystery drama than a superhero movie. Rather than rush from action scene to action scene, director Matt Reeves creates a dark, tense, slow-burning atmosphere reminiscent of David Fincher with visuals and action scenes that reminded me of a Frank Miller adaptation. Think Se7en meets Sin City.For the first two hours or so the only negative about the film was that it was maybe a touch too slow. In creating this atmosphere Reeves had slowed down the tempo too much. It was still brilliant though and looked set to be a masterpiece.Unfortunately, the last 30-40 minutes wreck any chances of the film being remembered more fondly. Reeves throws in one twist too many, a twist that takes us on an unfocused 30-40 minute digression. That last segment makes the film resemble more of an average superhero movie, with action at the expense of plot.Remove the final twist, have a tighter end to the mystery, lose 30 minutes or so at the end and this would have been an absolute masterpiece.

642,"This is essentially a film noir, Batman meets Sin City, mash up.Its experimental and in its own way, quite daring. For that and the fact it mostly works, I give it kudos. I'm equally impressed, by the suitably downbeat performances, from Robert Pattinson and Zoë Kravitz.The actors understand the kind of film they are in and adjust their performances, accordingly. That's not as easy as it sounds, given the glitzy, action packed handling, of previous ""Batman"" outings and the expectation, it creates.I'm afraid however, there is a ""but"" coming. This film basks a little too long, in its dark, fantasy world. Its a beautifully shot world, the cinematic's moodily excellent. That said, it could have been 30 minutes or so shorter and worked just as well.I think too, its clever in so much as they re-create old characters like the Penguin and Riddler, making them more human and relatable. That said, I would have used new characters, with a fresh perspective. This is after all, a departure from what Batman has been in the past, for the most part.Lastly, a there's little dash of throw away, anti ""white"" rhetoric, I could have done without.In summary, a mixed bag.

644,"The Batman, directed by Matt Reeves and starring Robert Pattinson, is a crime thriller/film noir take on the dark knight. Met with generally high praise from critics and audiences alike, the Batman soared into box office highs right off the bat. The Batman drew acclaim for its visuals, performances, score, and gritty atmosphere, drawing viewers deep into its world of crime, justice, and vengeance. While it is indeed well made and delves into themes and ideas heretofore unseen in batman films, The Batman is far from perfect and stumbles in some of its most important elements.The first hour and a half of the Batman is an engrossing film that hits on all cylinders and showcases Reeves technical talent and ability to incorporate Fincher like elements into his script. I was on the edge of my seat and the action scenes, while limited, were brilliant and exciting. Batman jumped from one crime scene to the next and the riddler kept outsmarting him at every turn, making for an engaging story of cat and mouse. Then came the third act and the movie began to fall apart. Reeves, on top of forcing in a severely under written love story, fell pray to the cardinal marvel movie sin: a by the numbers action movie mumbo jumbo conclusion. After all the buildup, the riddler is sidelined in his own war and batman fights a bunch of masked thugs. Michael Giacchino tries his best to make the broken-hearted love story seem emotional but, ultimately, can only do so much with his music. While I do believe they provided a solid character arc for batman, starting him out as a man of vengeance and then making him realize that those ideals are shared by his enemies, they dropped the ball on a finale that could've capped off greatness.",batman direct matt reev star robert pattinson crime thrillerfilm noir take dark knight met gener high prais critic audienc alik batman soar box offic high right bat batman drew acclaim visual perform score gritti atmospher draw viewer deep world crime justic vengeanc inde well made delv theme idea heretofor unseen batman film batman far perfect stumbl import elementsth first hour half batman engross film hit cylind showcas reev technic talent abil incorpor fincher like element script edg seat action scene limit brilliant excit batman jump one crime scene next riddler kept outsmart everi turn make engag stori cat mous came third act movi began fall apart reev top forc sever written love stori fell pray cardin marvel movi sin number action movi mumbo jumbo conclus buildup riddler sidelin war batman fight bunch mask thug michael giacchino tri best make brokenheart love stori seem emot ultim much music believ provid solid charact arc batman start man vengeanc make realiz ideal share enemi drop ball final couldv cap great,positive
645,"This year would mark the 14th year since The Dark Knight came out. After The Dark Knight made a milestone superhero film, another Batman movie has come out that takes the top place along with The Dark Knight to be the best of the genre. Not only that, but The Batman also transcends the genre following Joker and is a pure neo-noir rather than just a superhero movie. This was one of the finest films I was fortunate enough to experience in the cinemas.One of the first things that impressed me from the beginning was the soundtrack and specifically how it is used. Michael Giacchino has created a deeply moving, sometimes pressure inducing and other times adrenaline rushing soundtrack and the use and integration of the Something in the Way song by Nirvana just makes it all the more atmospheric.The first time we are introduced to Batman through the narration of his journal. It set the tone of the film as well as the confusion and rage of the character. When he says, ""I'm vengeance"" we believe it and that perfectly starts the character arc.Gotham City is as much a character for Batman stories as the titular character himself. Tim Burton movies showed a Gotham that is gothic and a little bit crazy. Nolan tried a bit of something in Batman Begins but decided to play it like any normal city in The Dark Knight. Here Matt Reeves gives life to Gotham as the crime-ridden cesspool it is where criminals grow like mushrooms after rain. The production design by James Chinlund and cinematography by Greig Fraser were on point to make sure the viewers feel immersed in that beautiful cesspool.The way the characters are created and explored, the city and how everything surrounding it exists feels much more realistic and comic-book-like at the same time compared to the Nolan movies. The bat suit looks like something custom made but in secret by a reclusive billionaire, not like the factory model, that is most of the suits yet. And the way the suit performs is also the best yet. Even when in the previous movies people called Batman crazy and freak, he always looked like a superhero. But here, the suit is perfect to call him the freak who dresses as a bat, nonetheless looking badass during the fights. Even the actual suit that is used for the shoot is the most manoeuvrable Batman suit among all the films. The same with the Batmobile. It is not a future-tech armoured vehicle, nor a bat-themed supercar for fun. It looks like a muscle car and comes with enough modifications so that it works the best way Batman needs it to.Being a neo-noir exploring the detective side of Batman, the movie doesn't overindulge in action sequences, but when it does, it delivers. Easily some of the best hand to hand fight sequences in superhero films and even outside them, these were solid. They were just enough to satisfy the audience and make them want more in the next part.These few aspects like the hand to hand fight sequences, the story and the characters being very personal and effective which were missing in the Nolan films, great as they were.Robert Pattinson has proved himself to be a great Batman who is still learning the ropes, which includes not yet learning to be Bruce Wayne. Zoe Kravitz's Selina Kyle was the badass heroine I wished Anne Hathway could have been. The chemistry between the Bat and the Cat was the best I have seen for a couple in a superhero film.I still feel like I'm in Gotham hours after I came out of the theatre.

648,"I was really enthusiastic about Reeve's interviews, it finally seemed like his version would be more accurate to the comics, which I think it's been failing long enough with Batman movies.The dark detective noir story is there, in fact, and there's some great atmosphere with the first 15 minutes of the movie totally exciting me about how this was going.The settings and cinematography of the movie are really great, I absolutely loved that aspect of this movie, and the design of Batman suit doesn't look that bad in the dark even though it's definitely not my favourite live action version.Now, I really wanted to like Pattison's version of the character, I like a lot of his work, but this is an absolute miss. I thought so from the very first news of his casting, but I kept hopeful for a surprise that didn't come.As batman, he's definitely not imponent, his un-athletic frame and skinny legs wouldn't impose fear to a little girl, it really annoys me that he didn't put any effort on the physical side of his character (which is SO important for this role!), you can tell he didn't do any serious exercise when you see his torso and arms naked. I'm sure he got paid enough to have done better than that, it's almost disrespectful. And before you think ""oh, but this is Batman starting, he gets bigger later"": WRONG! He trains for years in Asia before he gets back and he's fully prepared physically, what he gains through being Batman in Gotham is experience, knowledge and new gadgets.In terms of performance, his Bruce Wayne is pretty much an emo, which is all the opposite to what the character does in the comic books to get as far away from suspicion as possible. Another miss. He never shows his sadness and tortured personality as Bruce Wayne.Not the looks, not the performance.The fights were somehow cool, mostly thanks to the cinematography, but after the first fight when Bats uses one of his ""weapons"", he totally forgets about his belt and doesn't do anything else than punching and kicking, and I don't find that satisfying enough, Batman's gadgets is one of the things that give him advantage over any other fighter or a bunch of fighters. It's a disappointment to see how the director thought about Batman's technology for his detective work but almost nothing on his fighting.In terms of villains, there were moments where Riddler was creepy enough to give chills, but it fell flat in the end. Penguin didn't strike in any particular way, even though Farrell is a great actor, the character felt washed down and wasted for me, lacking a lot of his classic characteristics.Catwoman looks good but also, didn't felt much like the comic book, could definitely have done more in such a long run of a film.I feel these realistic takes of Batman are killing the character in movies, I don't know why directors and writers fill their mouths saying they're fans and they want to be faithful to the comics and they make Batmans that can't do anything of what the character normally does.I whish someone would chill out a bit and make it a bit more fantastic within the character's characteristics.This one in particular is even more realistic than Nolan's, and for me, that's a very bad thing, I had enough of normal guys walking around in a useless armour throwing punches standing like robots.I can only hope this director is saving the gargets and abilities aspect for future movies, to show improvement and evolution on the character, but I think it could have been done in THIS movie, being over two and half hours there was more than enough time to show it!As a movie is not bad, but neither great. The pace is too slow, it really drags by times, with long, redundant conversations, repetitive scenes and the characters not too well adapted, specially Pattison's Batman.Another disappointment for me, because I keep waiting for a proper adaptation of the Batman from the comic books, as there's never been one.I whish Affleck would have done his take, with Deathstroke, his cool Batsuit, more action, more fun. His version was BY FAR the best, no way anyone can say his assault to rescue Martha wasn't the BEST Batman scene ever filmed so far.I'll keep waiting..",realli enthusiast reev interview final seem like version would accur comic think fail long enough batman moviesth dark detect noir stori fact there great atmospher first minut movi total excit goingth set cinematographi movi realli great absolut love aspect movi design batman suit doesnt look bad dark even though definit favourit live action versionnow realli want like pattison version charact like lot work absolut miss thought first news cast kept hope surpris didnt comea batman he definit impon unathlet frame skinni leg wouldnt impos fear littl girl realli annoy didnt put effort physic side charact import role tell didnt seriou exercis see torso arm nake im sure got paid enough done better almost disrespect think oh batman start get bigger later wrong train year asia get back he fulli prepar physic gain batman gotham experi knowledg new gadgetsin term perform bruce wayn pretti much emo opposit charact comic book get far away suspicion possibl anoth miss never show sad tortur person bruce waynenot look performanceth fight somehow cool mostli thank cinematographi first fight bat use one weapon total forget belt doesnt anyth el punch kick dont find satisfi enough batman gadget one thing give advantag fighter bunch fighter disappoint see director thought batman technolog detect work almost noth fightingin term villain moment riddler creepi enough give chill fell flat end penguin didnt strike particular way even though farrel great actor charact felt wash wast lack lot classic characteristicscatwoman look good also didnt felt much like comic book could definit done long run filmi feel realist take batman kill charact movi dont know director writer fill mouth say theyr fan want faith comic make batman cant anyth charact normal doesi whish someon would chill bit make bit fantast within charact characteristicsthi one particular even realist nolan that bad thing enough normal guy walk around useless armour throw punch stand like robotsi hope director save garget abil aspect futur movi show improv evolut charact think could done movi two half hour enough time show ita movi bad neither great pace slow realli drag time long redund convers repetit scene charact well adapt special pattison batmananoth disappoint keep wait proper adapt batman comic book there never onei whish affleck would done take deathstrok cool batsuit action fun version far best way anyon say assault rescu martha wasnt best batman scene ever film faril keep wait,positive

651,"Have people forgotten what a good movie is? Because this is a really good movie, borderline great, And? People call it out as slow and boring... That is not good enough critique! That is lazy viewing. I saw a lot of these type of reviews for other Matt Reeves films that I found equally baffling. He is a solid director formulating a strong resume of material.Obviously this film is polarizing. Seems like people either love or hate it, not a lot in-between. I think a lot of viewers today need constant stimulation, like in Spiderman No Way Home. A movie like that is adored for easy, light approach, regardless of insipid story elements straight out of the kiddie pool. That movie chases a world saving plot line that stems from... a teenagers issues with image and applying to college. In The Batman, concerns are real - the tone is dark, and the main character has to earn his way to victory. I also think many viewers are turned off by the all too human nature of this Batman version. Not me! That is the essence of that hero! And I love Pattinson's interpretation of this character; the character built through round tables and rehearsal.It is a long movie. Too long? I think so, especially the third act that seems to conclude about 6 times, before actually ending. I understand the desire to include all these story elements and extend the reach of the villain, but it seemed very difficult to maintain proper pace through the films final 40 minutes.But up to that point? I was fully engaged and mesmerized by the high quality film making, characters and their performances.What defines The Batman? I would call it a coming of age story where Batman re-discovers himself, the hero - his place in Gotham, and who and what he cares about. This version of Batman is arrived at fully formed - his presence within the city is understood by all elements, and accepted (grudgingly) by law enforcement. The villain comes off as very complicated, even somewhat likable. His crimes have vision and intelligence, even if ultimately he is a wildly damaged individual who is bent by pursuing chaos. The Batman shows the protagonist and antagonist as two sides of the same coin, but how important morality is in arriving at heroic conclusions. This exploration is enhanced by the Cat-woman character that is driven by revenge, but through her interaction with Batman, makes different choices than she otherwise might.Like Reeves other films, The Batman is deep, textured (visually and thematically) and meaningful. I also found it to be fabulous entertainment.",peopl forgotten good movi realli good movi borderlin great peopl call slow bore good enough critiqu lazi view saw lot type review matt reev film found equal baffl solid director formul strong resum materialobvi film polar seem like peopl either love hate lot inbetween think lot viewer today need constant stimul like spiderman way home movi like ador easi light approach regardless insipid stori element straight kiddi pool movi chase world save plot line stem teenag issu imag appli colleg batman concern real tone dark main charact earn way victori also think mani viewer turn human natur batman version essenc hero love pattinson interpret charact charact built round tabl rehearsalit long movi long think especi third act seem conclud time actual end understand desir includ stori element extend reach villain seem difficult maintain proper pace film final minutesbut point fulli engag mesmer high qualiti film make charact performanceswhat defin batman would call come age stori batman rediscov hero place gotham care version batman arriv fulli form presenc within citi understood element accept grudgingli law enforc villain come complic even somewhat likabl crime vision intellig even ultim wildli damag individu bent pursu chao batman show protagonist antagonist two side coin import moral arriv heroic conclus explor enhanc catwoman charact driven reveng interact batman make differ choic otherwis mightlik reev film batman deep textur visual themat meaning also found fabul entertain,positive
652,"Taking notes from 2019's ""Joker,"" the newest iteration of Batman, which is aptly titled, ""The Batman,"" is a dark, brooding character study that feels less like a superhero film and more of a David Fincher psychological crime drama. Even going as far as to open with a scene of brutal murder, ""The Batman"" is unlike any other live action film that has previously depicted the caped crusader. And with that comes positives and negatives.Batman is by far my favorite superhero - and in this movie, he does not disappoint. Robert Pattinson play a moody, emo, young-adult Bruce Wayne who is obviously not well-adjusted to the world. Sure, he may be a billionaire, but he is no playboy or philanthropist. Instead, this film's Bruce Wayne is a reclusive introvert who spends most of his time prowling the streets at night for his next targets. Yes, Batman is not seeking out to necessarily save people but instead to violently brutalize thugs while telling them that his name is ""Vengeance"" - this leads to a fantastic introduction to Batman's character where he engages in hand to hand combat with a group of thugs, showing absolutely no mercy. It's clear that Bruce/Batman has a lot of pent up aggression; but unlike Affleck's Batman who utilized his raw strength to beat enemies to a pulp, Pattinson is still green. Having been The Dark Knight for only two years, Pattinson portrays a more vulnerable, less careful superhero, one who is getting hurt almost as much as he hurts others. However, instead of packing this film with high-octane fight sequences, ""The Batman"" aims to thrill through its depiction of a noir murder mystery.Paul Dano plays The Riddler, who is keen on picking off Gotham's high profile politicians and law enforcement officials. When the mayor of Gotham is found murdered, Batman must put his patented detective skills to work to figure out who is doing the killing, and why. Due to this change in tone that is so unlike any other Batman movie we've had before, ""The Batman"" has a very methodical, borderline slow-moving pace to it. Combine that with the three-hour long runtime, and you have a recipe for either disaster, or triumph. The long runtime is definitely what is going to turn people off from the film. A three hour superhero movie certainly isn't the norm, and both times I saw this film in theatres, I could definitely pick up on the antsyness of the audience. That said, even with such a long runtime, the movie's pacing is practically perfect. There is always something happening or about to happen, with an action beat occurring every 20 minutes or so. That said, because the movie has such a serious, brooding tone, the film never necessarily feels like it's picking up.It's clear that director Matt Reeves wanted this movie to forego all traditional superhero tropes, and instead cater to slow-burn, adult thrillers. While that can be effective, and is for a majority of the film, in my opinion the slow-burn almost added a level of stagnation to the movie due to the fact that the tone is relentless and constant throughout all three hours of the film. For ""The Batman's"" entirety, the film almost goes out of its way to deny its audience from any high-octane thrills or spectacular action set pieces. Even with the, admittedly, breathtaking car chase that has been featured in virtually every trailer for this movie, even that has a sort of slow-moving, ""artistic"" feel to it because of the fact that Matt Reeves decides to show most of the chase through the point of view of who Batman is chasing. Because of that, you don't get the gorgeous wide shots that you do in, for example, ""The Dark Knight's"" car chase set piece. Instead, in ""The Batman,"" the chase takes place mostly in the cockpit of the vehicles, not allowing you to see the chase in all its glory. Fight sequences are filmed similarly, in that there is almost always something that slightly obscures the action - a scene that immediately comes to mind is a hallway fight that is completely light-less except for occasional bursts of muzzle flair - you may have seen this in the trailer! Yes, it looks beautiful, but the beauty does take away from the intensity of the action.I also had a problem with this movie's villain. While Paul Dano is one of the best actors working today, it is glaringly obvious that his Riddler takes inspiration from another villain who enjoys wearing clown makeup. Additionally, ""The Batman"" lacked the emotional hook that Nolan's movies contained. A common criticism of this film is that there was a lack of emotional resonance, and I agree. I love Batman, obviously, which kept me engaged in the movie, but besides that I never necessarily felt connected to any of the characters. All these negatives aside, ""The Batman,"" does offer a compelling, endlessly watchable Batman adventure. There is a lot to like, and even love, here. Pattinson portrays one of my favorite iterations of both Bruce and Batman, and Matt Reeves packs this film with gorgeous, if relatively unexciting, action sequences. Paul Dano's Riddler has many memorable sequences - I just wish he was in the film more than he is.""The Batman"" won't be everyone's cup of tea. It's long, it's slow, and it's seriousness and darkness doesn't make for the most thrilling movie. However, if you're at all, and in any way, a fan of Batman, you are going to at least like this movie. This is not my favorite Batman movie, but it is one that I am going to rewatch an endless amount of times because, well, it entertained me.

The whole movie it seemed to be raining, I know it was trying to up play Edward Cullens sorrow and depression but it got pretty annoying, just a dark movie. The Batmobile was just a Dodge Hellcat and all of his equipment was pretty outdated and lame. Batman really got lucky in this one, no one out of the many clips of ammo shot at him could seem to hit him in his wildly exposed face and taking a c4 explosion to the face didn't even leave a mark! He got saved several times, he could have died in the wreck chasing the penguin but thankfully he happened to be behind a semi designed to tow cars which happened to align perfect for him to jump the huge wreck he had just caused. You know, it's hard to get past that scene where he chases the penguin down causing a 50 car pile up on the interstate just to find out the penguin had nothing to do with the movie as well. Alfred could have answered most every question he had without needing to go through the first 2 hours of the movie, that was kind of irritating. I couldn't help but notice it sounding like Batman was walking with spurs on the whole movie, it sounded like his boots were full of quarters and they seemed to zoom in on them the whole movie.. IDK just a couple of the things I noticed. The movie had many chances to end but it decided to try and stretch the budget. Robert Pattinson just wasn't it in this one.

655,"LIKES:The Acting:
A strong opening for much of the film, the Batman's cast excels where other directions in the DC movies have not hit so hard. Jeffrey Wright is a wonderful Commissioner Gordon. He's got great character development with a wonderful delivery of the frustration he is facing in this mystery. Kravitz as the new Selena Kyle is the blend of physical and emotional acting that this character holds, being one of the best Catwoman roles in a long time. She's got the moves during the fights, but the heart of the anti-hero is solid, and a great opposite to the Bat in this game of uncovering the truth. As for all the other characters, I could go on paragraphs alone of how well they hit their marks in this blend of modern with classic Batman, but I can say Reeves has helmed quite a cast to bring this new approach to life. As for Pattinson, I did not hate him, and feel he pulled the Tenet and Lighthouse acting into a role that is dark, foreboding, and angry as expected in the first two years of the Bat's career. From a story aspect it works, and Pattinson manages to pull some great punches into handling the emotional role, while the broodiness makes for a simplistic and monotone character that pales to the others in this film.The World Building:
Reeves has done a great job establishing the new direction with the Gotham City and pulls you into just how dark and dingy the city of Batman is. While Tim Burton's style was a playful, whimsical architecture that captured lots of styles, Reeves take is more realistic and feels very much like a city in need of cleaning up. All the shadows, the designs of the clubs and buildings have shed the comic book feeling, and instead dove into more of the graphic novel, realism approach that goes so well with the story. It sets the stage for lots of story potential in what will most likely have sequels, and offers many facets of the city to make an ecosystem that Batman will be playing in. All the designs and new angles they took were wonderful for me and the story elements for our Bat to face will evolve well if done right.The Cinematography:
It's good, and Reeves has indeed shot a great movie that looks beautiful on just a simple screen. The shadows tell lots of stories in this movie, with plenty of angles and use to establish the mood and dangers of the criminal world we are in. Filters that add grey help further add the foreboding nature of this film, giving us the feeling that even light does not bring safety in this Seven like approach they took. Even the angles taken for how light serves as a temporary reprieve are shot beautifully, with so much captured in the lighting and angles, each shot meticulously planned to give you the optimum emotion and punch that they needed. This is a film that will do well in the IMAX films, and will probably look even better on and advanced screen.The Costumes/Makeup:
I have to give him props to the wardrobe/makeup team, because they have accomplished wonders in this film. The Bat suit looks good, it's dark, it's basic, and fits the early years approach they are taking quite well like an early Spiderman suit from Marvel, though the eye issues are still present. The rest of the group has some style to it, and keeps the realistic edge of the movie, but still holds the comic book basis that we love to see in this franchise. Throw in wigs, outfits for a little more elevation and there is a nice style that many will enjoy for one reason or the other. The biggest achievement though is the Penguin's makeup, and just the transformation they did to the actor to make him into the future villain we know him to be.The Action Scenes to A Level:
As this movie gears towards realism, the action fits the themes as well, bringing bouts that feel as if they can actually happen and not quite as cartoony as the old Batman movies. When guys take punches, they feel it and get some shiners in the process, leading to more street brawling and timing hits than the spectacles of coordination. Catwoman's moves are sleek and stylish, and also have a level of planning that again goes with the themes of the film and don't go too elaborate. Even the chase scene holds more realism to it, and though has a little more octane added to the mix, keeps itself grounded compared to most modern-day car chase sequences. These fights hold more emotional stakes than anything, with Reeves again infusing a storytelling atmosphere to the shots that sort of illustrates the struggles our characters are facing. That symbolic nature gets thumbs up in terms of the balance it gives and how there is an anchor between physical action and the character development with it.The Plot:
Hands down, the best part of this movie for me, is the storytelling they are doing with this film and how it works with the three hours it has. The Batman is a much darker take on an already dark series, taking the elements from the Nolan series, and further swimming down into the tales this film has to offer. While there are plenty of symbolism moments that many will enjoy, the true genius is the mystery at hand within the Riddler's game. What starts out as an homage to the crime genre, quickly blends the Riddler's love of games with the new twist of deadliness not found in other media, a realistic danger that is very relevant to today's world. With the race against the clock, the stakes, and the mystery all dancing around pieces of information that talk more about our characters, it's a captivating moment that will get your intrigue going and keep you hooked through most of the movie. This is the biggest strength for me in this movie, and certainly a major supporting pillar for this film to base itself on.DISLIKES:Batman/Bruce Wayne's portrayal:
Can't say that I enjoyed the brooding, anguished, and monotone Bruce Wayne who bled into the same thing during Batman. I understand that there are often very little differences between the two in the medium, but other Batman movies have tried to utilize the alter egos a little more than what this installment did. Pattinson was fine in acting it out, but the fact they could not do more with the two personas to help gather more clues and keep the trail off of him a little better makes for a flatter Batman that again, is sort of weaker than the other characters in the film.More Alfred:
Ironically, I really liked this Alfred we got, and this butler character has been a staple to the franchise for longer than I've been alive. While Serkis' performance is stellar, the class, emotion, and depth all there ready to go, I must say they sort of short seated him more than they did Batman and Robin's legendary character. More time was needed with Alfred, perhaps to help elevate the Bruce Wayne moments, or perhaps to put his own hat in the ring of solving the Riddler mystery. While Serkis manages to maximize the small amount of time with quality acting, this is the character I wanted more of in this film to help keep the quality performances coming and the promise of what is to come in this latest franchise.The Action to Another Degree:
I know, this movie was going for something different, taking the realistic and brooding approach, compared to the man in tights feel we've gotten several times. It does not mean it had to be devoid of special effects and Hollywood magic to the point of being a little too plain and simplified for my superhero taste. The action of The Batman needs a bit more spice for people like me, mixing some big-time score, a little more coordination and gadgets we love, and trying to add a little more comic book element to relieve some of the darker tones. As I said, the action plays to the rules well, but the lack of adding sound editing, an upbeat score and variety to the fights makes the action part of this movie a little dull for me. Much of the film is really more about that brutality and anger component, something symbolism guys will eat up, but to not add a little variety until the very end (which is still not that spiced up) makes for a bit of a boring and bland Batman film.Too Much in One Film?I always think that studios try to do too much in one movie and push one or two steps too far to try and get all the stuff in. The Batman is a movie that I think took one or two steps that needed to be pulled back, leading to some components feeling a bit forced, not needed, or dare I say semi-complete in my book. This film has a lot of staples in the film, and while many of them are fantastically blending, there are other that are combed over and left vague, probably for the plans I read about the franchises to come. Sadly, like Disney, it seems WB is using this film as a springboard for an entire world of cinema, and those qualities sort of showed as hooks to reel you in to remakes and redos of Batman stories.The Invincible Suit:
You've seen the trailers enough time to know that this Batman seems to have a suit made by Iron Man, and I can't say I'm a big fan of it. All the realism, the bland fights, and the emotions are fine and dandy, but to throw it all away by making a Batman suit that can take a lot of fire and have little repercussions, takes away from the danger element in these moments. While I know Batman has had some blows bounce off, most of the Batman media puts a lot more danger that requires him to fight smarter, displaying Batman's intellect and preparation. This film though, makes his prototype first suit better than most of his later models, leaving me rolling my eyes at the absurdity of how proof his suit is in this installment. While the ending finally cracks that code, it's a broken mechanic and my least favorite aspect of the movie, due to how much it breaks the mold of what Reeves established in this movie.My scores for this film are:Action/Crime/Drama: 8.5

657,"Batman has had lots of movies through the years and he did a bit of detective work, but not much. So this movie obviously wanted to showcase this ability of The Batman and it does so very well having a very good set of villains as this Riddler is much more what I am used to in the comics, the Penguin is not some mutated dude raised by penguins and corruption is the key to everything. We get a new Batman in Robert Pattison and he does a very good job, more dark and brooding and without all the growling and shouting of Bale's. The movie is dark and just very interesting as it truly had me wondering who and what was the endgame. However, there is action, so do not let people try to say that the film is absent of some good old punching!The story, key political figures are being dispatched, first it is the mayor. The person responsible leaves chilling riddles behind and seems to be taking an interest in Batman who is already Batman so no origin story here. Batman is already working with Gordon and looks over the crime scene. Soon things start to point to this person or that and even Bruce's father may have a part in it as the Riddler's game turns out to be even more heinous than even Batman could guess!Pattison was very good as Batman, he was not super muscular like the Batman in the comics, but really the only guy who pumped up for the role was Ben Affleck's Batman. I would put Robert in a tie with Bale in second as they both look fit, but not really jacked up. Colin is great as the Penguin and I was totally surprised to find Andy Serkis was Alfred. I kept thinking I know him from somewhere, but I guess I just did not think of the actor as old enough to be Alfred. Zoe Kravitz is a rather good Catwoman, not quite Michelle's but better than the one from Rising. The Batmobile I rather liked, like the Batmobile fused with Mad Max's vehicle!So, this film was good, I would say it is my fave Batman, but one always tends to fall in love with something when they see it for the first time, so I'll hold judgement. I am very curious to see where this is going and if they team up who I think they are going to team up, that would be really cool. I definitely think Robert can do the job, was not a fan of Twilight, but come on, everyone has to get their start somewhere, and he was so dark in this film, most will forget that he ever sparkled.",batman lot movi year bit detect work much movi obvious want showcas abil batman well good set villain riddler much use comic penguin mutat dude rais penguin corrupt key everyth get new batman robert pattison good job dark brood without growl shout bale movi dark interest truli wonder endgam howev action let peopl tri say film absent good old punchingth stori key polit figur dispatch first mayor person respons leav chill riddl behind seem take interest batman alreadi batman origin stori batman alreadi work gordon look crime scene soon thing start point person even bruce father may part riddler game turn even heinou even batman could guesspattison good batman super muscular like batman comic realli guy pump role ben affleck batman would put robert tie bale second look fit realli jack colin great penguin total surpris find andi serki alfr kept think know somewher guess think actor old enough alfr zoe kravitz rather good catwoman quit michel better one rise batmobil rather like like batmobil fuse mad max vehicleso film good would say fave batman one alway tend fall love someth see first time ill hold judgement curiou see go team think go team would realli cool definit think robert job fan twilight come everyon get start somewher dark film forget ever sparkl,positive

660,"What I liked
I thought Robert Pattinson was great as Batman
It's dark and gritty
It's noir feel and attempt to stay true to the comics
Action sequences were awesome
Cinematography
It's realism; you can tell Matt reeves payed attention to what Chris Nolan did in the dark knight series with minimal cgi and realistic effectsWhat I didn't like
It's way to long and drawn out; at 3 hours long it needed a better storyline to hold up each plot.It's tries to be complicated and intriguing but feels flat a lot of the time.Alfred has very little to with anything in this batman
The noir feel is great but it really needed more action to keep it exciting
The riddler; he felt overacted and at times it was hard to understand what was being said
Some characters defiantly felt miscast
The ending; this movie tried to build and build to an ending that is good but misses the markOverall
The movie is good, I thought Robert Pattinson was batman, the suite looked great and liked the feel of the movie even if it's a very dark portrayal of the batman universe.It's wayyyyyy to long given the story line; i wanted to be excited but I just wasn't. I like what Matt Reeves has done as this is a totally different portrayal of Batman but it tries to hard in a lot of areas and doesn't do enough of what makes it's stand out.Good movie but i defiantly think it will have its critics.",like thought robert pattinson great batman dark gritti noir feel attempt stay true comic action sequenc awesom cinematographi realism tell matt reev pay attent chri nolan dark knight seri minim cgi realist effectswhat didnt like way long drawn hour long need better storylin hold plotit tri complic intrigu feel flat lot timealfr littl anyth batman noir feel great realli need action keep excit riddler felt overact time hard understand said charact defiantli felt miscast end movi tri build build end good miss markoveral movi good thought robert pattinson batman suit look great like feel movi even dark portray batman universeit wayyyyyi long given stori line want excit wasnt like matt reev done total differ portray batman tri hard lot area doesnt enough make stand outgood movi defiantli think critic,positive

Here we get to see him being a great detective, and I'll admit I loved seeing him being a hero for the civilians at the end. I wasn't wild about Andy Serkis as Alfred and was indifferent towards Zoe Kravitz as Catwoman. But Pattinson, Dano, Farrell, and Wright are all great. I particularly liked seeing Gordon get a lot of screen time as he's my favorite Batman ally.

666,"The story of this film seemed very simple and unnecessary to develop it in 3 hours.There are elements that do not modify the plot much and that would modify the duration of this story, which although it lasts 3 hours, it does not have a complete development, there are many confusing things that you need to think about several times to make sense, due to the little context that gives us about it. Even though there is a mystery to solve, it doesn't seem like it needs a resolution, plus the antagonist's mission ends up being very superficial and stupid even though it seems to be justifiable at first. I think it's a solid Batman despite not giving us a specific focus on what he is trying to achieve, is also accompanied by a good performance, but the other characters seem flat and some totally caricatured, the dark tone of the film works well but the mystery does not end up convincing me. The action scenes are good and look good, although the car persecution looks a bit ridiculous, the CGI looks very fake, especially in the last scenes, although the practical effects look good, when there are panoramic shots of the city from Gotham, these make the city shine, the performances are generally good, the music is good.I think it was not necessary for the story to be told in three hours since most of what happened does not have a great impact on the plot, but the technical aspects make it not entirely forgettable, especially because of the action scenes, a car crash scene at the beginning and for the compromised performances despite not having a good character development, its biggest flaw is a very weak script despite the well-done technical aspects, maybe it works once but I don't think it will a movie that you can watch many times in a row.",stori film seem simpl unnecessari develop hoursther element modifi plot much would modifi durat stori although last hour complet develop mani confus thing need think sever time make sen due littl context give u even though mysteri solv doesnt seem like need resolut plu antagonist mission end superfici stupid even though seem justifi first think solid batman despit give u specif focu tri achiev also accompani good perform charact seem flat total caricatur dark tone film work well mysteri end convinc action scene good look good although car persecut look bit ridicul cgi look fake especi last scene although practic effect look good panoram shot citi gotham make citi shine perform gener good music goodi think necessari stori told three hour sinc happen great impact plot technic aspect make entir forgett especi action scene car crash scene begin compromis perform despit good charact develop biggest flaw weak script despit welldon technic aspect mayb work dont think movi watch mani time row,positive
667,"The Batman is an action packed movie starring Robert Pattinson as Batman and Paul Dano as the villain, The Riddler who is a mental criminal with a whole team of clones. The movie is 177 minutes (3 hours) long. This movie isn't really superhero but more detective like. Sadly Bruce in this movie has no trouble with strait up killing people. The Riddler to me is a maniac, basically the Jokers brother. He has something wrong with his brain. This movie is quite greusome and I would recommend it for 12+ because younger viewers will have trouble following along with the movie. I like The Dark Knight better because it has story and is heartwarming.The riddler had only a few victims that he killed himself and each death had a message to Bruce (Batman) but while The Riddler was put in prison next to the joker (thats what I think) he killed 70 more people using bombs to destroy the waterbreakers aroung the city of Gotham causing a flood. One of the last messages to batman ended up killing Alfred because it was a bomb. Bruce couldn't save him. This is an amazing movie and is avalible on Prime Video and other streaming services.

668,"I love Batman, Michael Keaton in Batman Returns set the iconic portrayal for me, at its peak, as I was a kid of the 90s.You can imagine my excitement to finally revisit a darker more gritty low-tech, almost cyberpunk iteration of a dark & early Batman.Here's my honest opinion. This film doesn't live up to its incredible hype riding on its shoulders. It's underwhelming, spotty, and nearly everything is already glimpsed in the trailer. Robert Pattinson made an okay Batman but an awkward bad casting for Bruce Wayne. I gave him a chance but he just didn't fit. Zoe Kravitz on the other hand was the best performance and stole the whole show for me.In my opinion Gotham City has never looked better, the atmosphere is nice, the music is nice. But the story crumbles under a heavy dragging pace that nearly put me and my guest to sleep. It became a chore trying to stay awake. And by the end, it was entirely forgettable and a lackluster one-time-watch.I don't say that with remorse or incredible disappointment. I appreciated the detective-noir aesthetic. I just felt the film was shockingly under-cooked.I came for Zoe Kravitz and she alone made it worth a one-time-watch. But I think this film was too all over the place, lengthy, and shockingly tedious and underwhelming. Won't be watching again, but I can celebrate this small success because I'd still rather take this over the Nolan versions. This just didn't feel like it fit the landing.I was expecting more from the director of Cloverfield, but I can see this must have been a very daunting project to take on.Gotham City and Zoe Kravitz have never looked more beautiful, and she was great in this limited role.",love batman michael keaton batman return set icon portray peak kid syou imagin excit final revisit darker gritti lowtech almost cyberpunk iter dark earli batmanher honest opinion film doesnt live incred hype ride shoulder underwhelm spotti nearli everyth alreadi glimps trailer robert pattinson made okay batman awkward bad cast bruce wayn gave chanc didnt fit zoe kravitz hand best perform stole whole show mein opinion gotham citi never look better atmospher nice music nice stori crumbl heavi drag pace nearli put guest sleep becam chore tri stay awak end entir forgett lacklust onetimewatchi dont say remors incred disappoint appreci detectivenoir aesthet felt film shockingli undercookedi came zoe kravitz alon made worth onetimewatch think film place lengthi shockingli tediou underwhelm wont watch celebr small success id still rather take nolan version didnt feel like fit landingi expect director cloverfield see must daunt project take ongotham citi zoe kravitz never look beauti great limit role,positive

678,"From the first scene itself, it is made clear the amount of thought, work and creativity that has gone into the making of this movie. This movie will scare you, indulge you in its mystery, excite you with its action and amaze you with its commitment to telling a truly dark and gritty tale about the corruption in Gotham. Matt Reeves has done masterful work in directing each scene. He is a point of view driven director. There are many shots in this movie where he puts you in the character's shoes and shows the world from his point of view and how the world perceives him. As Batman enters the crime scene you are put in his POV and can see how much each and every police officer sees him as a menace and doesn't want him to be there. This really helps establish the world and the relationship within in a very subtle way. He also has wonderfully implemented some scenes of horror and thriller which were unexpected and had given way to some nailbiting and riveting scenes! (I think I forgot to breathe during the Batmobile chase scene)
All the Matt Reeves direction has been enhanced by Greg Fraser's camerawork. Gotham is very dark and gritty but never feels dead. Unlike so many other movies, he allowed blacks to be actual black and not shades of grey and then dialled up the contrast allowing the colours to pop! Orange and blue colour has such amazing interplay between them and completely suits the dark depressing setting of Gotham.Michael Giacchino's score for The Batman is his best work yet. As the film picks up in terms of action, you can start hearing little hints of Dum-Da-Dum-Dum pick up and you just know things are going to get intense. Other than the adrenaline-filled main theme he through his soundtrack is very well able to showcase moments of mystery, emotion and romance (Yes, this movie has romance!)
This might have been the least amount of talking done by The Batman in any of the Batman movies because Robert Pattinson is so well able to display emotions through his body language and expressions. Pattinson brings in a different take on Bruce Wayne, who is depressed and a little eccentric. A billionaire who has travelled the world to gather knowledge and is always analysing his surrounding is bound to be an introvert and kind of a recluse and this is very well showcased by him. Robert has done an amazing job. Talking about side characters there were loads of them and each one of them has done an amazing job. For me, the stand-out was definitely Penguin and Catwoman.The story is a straight-up murder mystery thriller where Batman and Gordon are sent on a hunt by Riddler which reveals the deep dark secret of Gotham Elites including Batman's own past. Without spoiling much the story plays out very much like Se7en, Zodiac and The Long Halloween comic book. This allows the world's greatest detective to actually do some detective work and you get lost in that journey to trying to piece all the different puzzle pieces. The Batman is not a good story because it's an indulging murder mystery but because it allows the characters within to grow as well.

It begins with a narration from Robert Pattinson's Batman about the 'fear' his existence instils in the criminals of Gotham while showing a compilation of different everyday criminals carrying out their vices. After this, Batman is introduced both excitingly and violently, beating up some thugs at a tube station, and showing little restraint. This sets the expectations that this is the Batman that will bring a darker take to the character.The first half of the film is promising, including some particularly tense scenes, such as the funeral section, sure to produce goosebumps. Michael Giacchino's consistently epic score and the always dark and rainy setting dictate the pace of the film. Until the third act, there is the expectation that there is something more to come. Something more to find within this film. However, we arrive at the third act, and the mess unfolds.This iteration of a Batman film fails in a key way - Batman starts and ends the film as entirely the same character. There is no emotional development within this character. This is no fault of Pattinson, who is suited to the role, but not given enough to work with. Throughout the film, Bruce Wayne maintains the same characteristics, aggression, emotion from start to finish. As mentioned, near the beginning, Batman aggressively beats some thugs at a train station, showing little restraint. Near the end of the film Batman, again, aggressively beats one of Riddler's gunners, requiring Jeffrey Wright's James Gordon to stop him. There was simply no development of the character that resulted in his actions changing. At one point, the Bat learns that his father may not be the man he thought, and there was a great opportunity for a significant plot device to the story. However, after a brief exposition from Andy Serkis' Alfred Pennyworth, the matter is essentially settled, and Bruce offers no further reaction to this revelation. Perhaps where Pattinson is most allowed to provide emotion is through the narration of his journals, which are very good scenes, but the fact that this is where the most emotion is displayed is a disappointment. It could be said that The Batman needed less action and more storytelling.Paul Dano's Riddler is not the best of villains. His performance seems to usher in an essence of Heath Ledger's Joker, however, at times, it seems over the top. Regardless, up until the third act, he is nonetheless intriguing. He convincingly comes across as delusional, but somewhat justified. He is trying to cure the city of its corruption. However, this all falters away as soon as Matt Reeves decides that Riddler's actions should turn from targeting corrupt officials to anyone and everyone, including innocent civilians. Why this is done I truly do not know. The Riddler's motives become completely muddled, and he simply fades away as a generic killer seeking total destruction.As for the other characters in the film, Colin Farrell's Penguin is criminally underused. He had almost no significant role in the outcome of the story. Whether he was in the film or not, almost nothing of the outcome would have changed. It was almost as if this film teased the character as a marketing tool to promote the Penguin TV show, announced before this film was released. Farrell's performance is nonetheless excellent, as well as the makeup design of the character.As to quick mentions of other characters, Zoe Kravitz's Catwoman was fine. Jeffrey Wright was great as Officer Gordon and had a surprising amount of screentime. As for John Turturro as Falcone, it almost seemed like this character unnecessarily took attention away from better ones like Oswald Cobblepot.The Batman is certainly not a bad film, it is actually quite enjoyable. However, serious problems with the writing severely hinder it. The film had me thinking of David Fincher's Zodiac throughout. The cryptic puzzles laid out by the Riddler, the incredible darkness. I cannot help but think this film is both worse than The Dark Knight and worse than Zodiac. If you want a spectacular Batman film, head in Christopher Nolan's direction; if you want a cryptic, chilling detective film, look to Zodiac.",batman open stun cinematograph style film take approach gotham citi begin narrat robert pattinson batman fear exist instil crimin gotham show compil differ everyday crimin carri vice batman introduc excitingli violent beat thug tube station show littl restraint set expect batman bring darker take characterth first half film promis includ particularli ten scene funer section sure produc goosebump michael giacchino consist epic score alway dark raini set dictat pace film third act expect someth come someth find within film howev arriv third act mess unfoldsthi iter batman film fail key way batman start end film entir charact emot develop within charact fault pattinson suit role given enough work throughout film bruce wayn maintain characterist aggress emot start finish mention near begin batman aggress beat thug train station show littl restraint near end film batman aggress beat one riddler gunner requir jeffrey wright jame gordon stop simpli develop charact result action chang one point bat learn father may man thought great opportun signific plot devic stori howev brief exposit andi serki alfr pennyworth matter essenti settl bruce offer reaction revel perhap pattinson allow provid emot narrat journal good scene fact emot display disappoint could said batman need le action storytellingpaul dano riddler best villain perform seem usher essenc heath ledger joker howev time seem top regardless third act nonetheless intrigu convincingli come across delusion somewhat justifi tri cure citi corrupt howev falter away soon matt reev decid riddler action turn target corrupt offici anyon everyon includ innoc civilian done truli know riddler motiv becom complet muddl simpli fade away gener killer seek total destructiona charact film colin farrel penguin crimin underus almost signific role outcom stori whether film almost noth outcom would chang almost film tea charact market tool promot penguin tv show announc film releas farrel perform nonetheless excel well makeup design charactera quick mention charact zoe kravitz catwoman fine jeffrey wright great offic gordon surpris amount screentim john turturro falcon almost seem like charact unnecessarili took attent away better one like oswald cobblepotth batman certainli bad film actual quit enjoy howev seriou problem write sever hinder film think david fincher zodiac throughout cryptic puzzl laid riddler incred dark help think film wors dark knight wors zodiac want spectacular batman film head christoph nolan direct want cryptic chill detect film look zodiac,neutral

681,"If you like se7en + zodiac + true detective then you'll probably like this new batman rendition.I personally didnt really enjoy this 3 hours of dark & nighttime setting. All those black & yellow hue are okay at first but after 90minutes it just gets tedious. Plot wise eeeh its pretty okay if you dont mind convoluted plot and long drawn conclusion. You're gonna feel that almost 3hrs of runtime. It would've sufficed with 2hrs because some shot are just unnecessary and they pan the camera a bit too long, so it adds up. 2hrs would've been better.The question is, is Robert Pattinson a good batman? For me its to soon to tell, I dont mind him as batman. I think there's still room to grow. I do mind however, that he is so brooding, moody and almost emo batman (almost remind me to uh a certain gentleman who also likes the dark & sparkle, almost) at least there's character growth at the very end of movie. Which is why I said he's still got potential to be a better batman.There's so little of alfred and that's a shame.Paul dano as riddler is fine, I just wish he didn't wear a full mask that barely shows his eyes, felt like we missed a good performance. Though we finally saw him without his riddler mask, it just felt like a waste of his performance. Zoe kravitz as catwoman is great, better than her predeccessor Anne hathaway. She's mainly the movie's emotional core in my opinion.Also the theme of gotham being such a corrupt city run by mob, dirty cop & corrupt politician seems like an overdone. They're much better executed in nolan's trilogy and I think it provides such good closure and ending that revisiting this will of course draws unfavorable comparison.Oooohh but what a treat that Barry Keoghan, that laugh, that tease. Certainly perks me up from my seat. Now THAT'S the cherry on top of the long drawn out movies. Alas at the very end I just cannot wait for this to be over.

689,"The Good- The intro to the film was incredible. Cinematography and color scheme is great. They bring a lot of character to Gotham. The batsuit is the best and really fits Pattinson perfectly. The Batmobile design was incredible. Colin Farrell and Zoe Kravitz played their roles really well and the detective angle was pretty good while it lasted.The bad-
1) The film is based on a wrong premise. Batman and everyone else keep on calling him vengeance. Nothing in the film indicated that. He just does standard vigilante a$$ kicking with his fists throughout the film, nothing that indicates he is vengeful. Batman begins and dark knight and even Batfleck had brutal moments that could be considered vengeful but this had none of that. He even doesn't let catwoman get revenge on Falcone, yet they keep on repeating this theme just to justify the ending.2) The story focuses on batman and is mostly filmed with batman in frame, yet the characters that we are expected to care for were hardly present for more than 2 minutes in the film (Talking about Annika). It was clear she was dead right from the beginning and halfway through the film we are expected to care for her again and they get Falcone based on that and not all the other stuff he previously did?3) The way the film starts, it is established that batman has done nothing to reduce crime the past two years. In such a world Gordon who is oblivious to the corruption in the police force has no reasons to be trusting or an ally to the batman and the reason for doing so has not been addressed and is quite essential when you are building this new batman world.4) The Wayne's were made hinted as bad guys by riddler only to be contradicted by Falcone and then by Alfred in a matter of 10 minutes and that plotline was completely abandoned for Annika
5) Catwoman is just randomly brought back at the Gotham square garden as if they just remembered is in the filmThe terrible-
1) The amount of incompetence of the characters. Gordan is the most incompetent he's ever been. All he did in the film was read out riddles and just act surprised to the killings. Couldn't even protect the mayor elect properly. He just leaves penguin despite of him being involved at a drug exchange which was followed by a shootout and then a dangerous road chase where people certainly died coz of him. The cop who works for Falcone is a bad cop and even worse henchman. Couldn't even dispose Annika's body and catwoman's phone and brought her at the drug exchange for catwoman to conveniently find out.2) Riddler was horribly written. He clearly believed in what he was doing in exposing the corruption and the mob, and this was suppose to be a good lesson learned for the batman where he understands a way to go about change is to go after real bad guys like falcone and not petty criminals. Instead they shoehorned the idea of batman being vengeance as the problem.3) Batman says he learnt from his mistakes, cannot be vengeance anymore. So what are you gonna do as batman if not beat up bad guys? Rescue kittens from trees? He was suppose to do that as Bruce Wayne instead we have a Bruce Wayne who is not just recluse but looks overtly sad in public and gave me no indication that he is vengeful, just sad.4) The interrogating scene was TERRIBLE. It ruined a potentially good villain. Batman villains are crazy, but they are competent which is what makes them interesting. Making him an online incel and getting himself arrested with no contingency plan to fulfill this weird infatuation he has with the Bat was a bizarre way to end his arc and made him look incredibly stupid and wiped out his threatening aura instantly.5) Batman probably did more damage to the people in the garden by blowing off the glass roof than the fake riddlers did lol. There were no stakes in the final battle whatsoever. Those guys were after one mayor elect who barely got 2 minutes of screen-time before that and is just the most standard ""Hey look here's a good guy"" character I have ever seen. Moreover the flooding was just a cool moment they decided to give the riddler and was completely unnecessary.6) The last 40 minutes are sooo drawn out with unnecessary scenes like the joker riddler scene at arkham and the camera taking forever to show bat and the cat partning ways.7) Instead if using actions to make it look creepy they overly rely on overacting with over the top inflections in riddler's voice, slow dialogues and creepy music.",good intro film incred cinematographi color scheme great bring lot charact gotham batsuit best realli fit pattinson perfectli batmobil design incred colin farrel zoe kravitz play role realli well detect angl pretti good lastedth bad film base wrong premis batman everyon el keep call vengeanc noth film indic standard vigilant kick fist throughout film noth indic veng batman begin dark knight even batfleck brutal moment could consid veng none even doesnt let catwoman get reveng falcon yet keep repeat theme justifi end stori focus batman mostli film batman frame yet charact expect care hardli present minut film talk annika clear dead right begin halfway film expect care get falcon base stuff previous way film start establish batman done noth reduc crime past two year world gordon oblivi corrupt polic forc reason trust alli batman reason address quit essenti build new batman world wayn made hint bad guy riddler contradict falcon alfr matter minut plotlin complet abandon annika catwoman randomli brought back gotham squar garden rememb filmth terribl amount incompet charact gordan incompet he ever film read riddl act surpris kill couldnt even protect mayor elect properli leav penguin despit involv drug exchang follow shootout danger road chase peopl certainli die coz cop work falcon bad cop even wors henchman couldnt even dispos annika bodi catwoman phone brought drug exchang catwoman conveni find riddler horribl written clearli believ expo corrupt mob suppos good lesson learn batman understand way go chang go real bad guy like falcon petti crimin instead shoehorn idea batman vengeanc problem batman say learnt mistak vengeanc anymor gon na batman beat bad guy rescu kitten tree suppos bruce wayn instead bruce wayn reclus look overtli sad public gave indic veng sad interrog scene terribl ruin potenti good villain batman villain crazi compet make interest make onlin incel get arrest conting plan fulfil weird infatu bat bizarr way end arc made look incred stupid wipe threaten aura instantli batman probabl damag peopl garden blow glass roof fake riddler lol stake final battl whatsoev guy one mayor elect bare got minut screentim standard hey look here good guy charact ever seen moreov flood cool moment decid give riddler complet unnecessari last minut sooo drawn unnecessari scene like joker riddler scene arkham camera take forev show bat cat partn way instead use action make look creepi overli reli overact top inflect riddler voic slow dialogu creepi music,neutral

692,"Let me start off with what I liked.The cinematography is excellent, there are so many great scenes and the attention to detail is amazing. Great car chase scene and the part where Batman is walking up to Penguin while he is upside down was jaw dropping. The score is also amazing, one of the best movie themes that perfectly encapsulates the theme of the movie. The foundation of Gothams corruption is established very effectively throughout the movie and you can really get a good grasp of what gotham is like through visual storytelling and narration. Acting is phenomenal, Jeffrey Wright is great as Gordon, Colin Ferrell and Paul Dano are great. Zoe Kravitz plays my favorite live action Catwoman and Robert Pattinson was an excellent BatmanMy main flaws with the movie come from the writing. There are a lot of plot conveniences that allow the movie to continue but doesn't make sense at all in the context of the movie. Batman's face remains completely unscathed despite being an inch away from an explosion. No one thinks to check across the street from the Iceberg lounge even though the pictures CLEARLY reveal where the photos may have been taken, and we find out the Riddler was there all along? How did no one think to investigate across the street? The Riddler is able to perform all these crimes, and set up multiple bombs across the city with no help and not a rousing suspicion? Alfred just happens to open the package RIGHT BEFORE the bomb goes off just in time to throw it away, and he doesn't die? Catwoman saves Batman while he has a shotgun aimed right at his head? How does no one evacuate the auditorium when the Riddlers followers start shooting??My biggest flaw with the movie is the climax, which was very underwhelming since it didn't make sense. The Riddler had established throothe movie that he is targeting corrupt Gotham officials who are generally well respected in the public eye, but beneath the surface are really bad people. He wants to expose the lies then hsve been covered up. In other words, he has only targeted corrupt people, and not once in the movie is it established that he's willing to kill innocent people. He is upset that as an orphan, he was neglected and lived horrible conditions while people like Bruce Wayne lived comfortably. Why would he set up multiple bombs through out the city, potentially killing hundreds of innocent people and potentially creating hundreds of orphans that will likely live just how he lived? It just doesn't make sense for his character's motivation. Why not continue to go after the corrupt people of Gotham? Why kill innocent people, especially if that was never his goal throughout the movie? The climax just doesn't make sense and the movie is unsure of the Riddlers motivations. Also the later half of the third act with the Riddlers followers seems like a carbon copy of the third act of Joker. I'm sure this obviously wasn't intended but it didn't seem fresh at all. Also, there is nearly no character development at all, the movie ends with everyone practically the same as they were since the beginning of the movie. The only line that hints at any development at all is the Batman's closing monologue.That being said, I still think it's a great film but it definitely has its flaws.

Then in 1995 we got Batman Forever (directed by Joel Schumacher) with Jim Carrey playing The Riddler. If this latest film: The Batman (2022) portrayed some villian or character that we hadn't seen before, then maybe it would've been justified. But Penguin, Catwoman and Riddler have been done in Batman Returns (1992) and Batman Forever (1995). And done better. Michelle Pfeiffer's Selina Kyle/Catwoman, Danny De Vito's Penguin and Jim Carrey's Riddler were more interesting and cinematic than the said characters in The Batman (2022). Then in 1997 we got: Batman and Robin. Then in 2005 we got Christopher Nolan's return to a more serious tone with: Batman Begins, followed by The Dark Knight (2008) and The Dark Knight Rises (2012).

696,"For one that has loved the story of Batman since I was 8, I have gone through all of the versions of the story. From the comics, to the cartoons, through the big budget hollywood sagas. I love Keaton, Kilmer, and Bail. I fought against Afflick. But appreciated his portrayal. And even though I loved the twilight saga I also railed against Robert Pattinson as the Batman. But I have to admit that I was wrong he gave this portrayal the most meaningful in-depth and DC worthy version of Batman that I've ever seen. Batman is dark he is evil and good all in one he is haunted and he hopes and Pattinson embraced all of it I look forward to seeing at least three or four new movies with him portraying Batman. As for the Riddler he was absolutely genius. The penguin never would've known it was Colin Farrell unless I looked it up he was amazing.

699,"Good detective-based Batman movie, sort of feels like a spiritual successor to Batman: The Animated Series (maybe my favorite Batman version produced by Hollywood). Performances are very good, although the characters often speak in hushed tones for no apparent reason. The camera work is a bit chaotic and messy, but the film noir stylization is effective.The score by Michael Giacchino is excellent, very moody and beautiful. The production design is gorgeous--this is a very visually striking Gotham, and it hearkens back to Tim Burton's Gotham rather than Christopher Nolan's more realistic Chicago-esque Gotham. It tends to be a very impressive movie to watch from a visual standpoint.The opening hour of the movie is excellent, but unfortunately it cannot sustain that level of quality. The story is the weakest part, a meandering focus without a real purpose for the ""detective"" Batman. It's answered very early on who is committing the crimes (the Riddler), and unfortunately Paul Dano's take on the Riddler here doesn't do much. There are other villains too, most notably Colin Farrell's Oz/Penguin, who is a better villain and gives a better performance. Farrell is unrecognizable under the prosthetics and makeup, but he nearly steals the movie.Compared to Christopher Nolan's trilogy, all three of which had strong villainous presences, this one's villain is mostly seen in video. It mutes the impact of threat faced to Batman. And at nearly 3 hours, there isn't enough to support the length. It could have been chopped down 20-30 minutes and not lost anything. Tighter editing would have made this better.Zoe Kravitz is excellent as Selina Kyle/Catwoman, and her presence elevates the movie every time she's in it. And while Robert Pattinson makes for a very good Batman, he's not so much a Bruce Wayne. Jeffrey Wright and Andy Serkis are both good in their supporting roles, particularly Wright who makes for a sympathetic James Gordon.I really feel like this should have gone for an R rating, which would have given the storytellers more room to play with this darker noir-infused Batman. And the length is a hindrance in that it is both too long for this unfocused story, but also too short for what it needed to properly build it out. It almost seems like this would have been better as an HBO Max series with 10 episodes.Overall it's a good movie, worth seeing, but I don't think it will hold up well over time with repeat viewings.",good detectivebas batman movi sort feel like spiritu successor batman anim seri mayb favorit batman version produc hollywood perform good although charact often speak hush tone appar reason camera work bit chaotic messi film noir styliz effectiveth score michael giacchino excel moodi beauti product design gorgeousthi visual strike gotham hearken back tim burton gotham rather christoph nolan realist chicagoesqu gotham tend impress movi watch visual standpointth open hour movi excel unfortun sustain level qualiti stori weakest part meander focu without real purpos detect batman answer earli commit crime riddler unfortun paul dano take riddler doesnt much villain notabl colin farrel ozpenguin better villain give better perform farrel unrecogniz prosthet makeup nearli steal moviecompar christoph nolan trilog three strong villain presenc one villain mostli seen video mute impact threat face batman nearli hour isnt enough support length could chop minut lost anyth tighter edit would made betterzo kravitz excel selina kylecatwoman presenc elev movi everi time she robert pattinson make good batman he much bruce wayn jeffrey wright andi serki good support role particularli wright make sympathet jame gordoni realli feel like gone r rate would given storytel room play darker noirinfus batman length hindranc long unfocus stori also short need properli build almost seem like would better hbo max seri episodesoveral good movi worth see dont think hold well time repeat view,positive

701,"Not really sure why this movie is getting rapturous praise by audience scores. It's alright. Pales in comparison to the Nolan films, which were far more tightly focused and had superior characters. Not that this Batman film is bad, it's the best live action Batman movie in ten years, which given the movies in between isn't saying that much. Robert Pattinson doesn't bother playing Bruce Wayne, he's essentially Batman at all times, which is fine, but it does make his rare Bruce Wayne scenes suffer.This detective Gordon is just a gruff but honest cop, to such a fault it's almost parody. It's less compelling than the Gary oldman version, which wouldn't matter except for the fact that he's got probably the second most screen time in the movie. Catwoman is fine, but she's not really any better than previous versions.The beginning of this movie is great, the riddler is genuinely compelling, at least until the end where he just becomes over the top crazy. Speaking of which, the ending conflict comes out of nowhere and was clearly just there so the movie would have an actual climax. It wouldn't have felt like padding except for the fact that the movie is ungodly long. It did not need to be 3 hours.

710,"I'm not a fan of movies inspired by comics. The Marvel universe and the other parallel imaginary universes do not overwhelm or concern me. I use to judge movies as they are, and I believe that any cinematic genre provides opportunities to tell interesting stories, build characters that one can identify with or that one can energetically dislike, can raise or touch on universal human themes and, most importantly, can provide quality entertainment. That's right, this happened to me less often with comics-inspired movies. I can count on the fingers of one hand the ones I remember with pleasure, and I still have one finger left free: Todd Philips' 'Joker' before any other, the original 'Superman', 'Spider-man' edition 2002 and 'The Dark Knight'. 'The Batman' (2022) directed by Matt Reeves is a gloomy and complicated version of the complex intrigues of the metropolis of Gotham, but it fails to complete my gallery of exceptions and make the last finger useful.I'm not even sure that Batman in the version proposed by this movie is a superhero. The only time in the movie when he flies, he does it only as a last resort, after obvious hesitations, and the aerial promenade ends almost catastrophically, with an emergency landing. His identity is known to almost everyone, of course to the audience, but as long as he plays his role, he doesn't take off his mask even when he kisses, that's how it goes in comics. His nemesis is The Riddler, a vigilante who uses serial killer methods, and for a long time we are in a situation of ambiguity, because from a moral point of view at least, the two seem to be on the same side of Good (or Evil) . The script proposes a complicated detective intrigue, sprinkled with riddles that the assassin leaves at the scenes of his crimes, addressed especially to Batman. Catwoman also shows up, with a parallel personal story of her own. The two, along with Police Commissioner Gordon, will fight alone against a corrupt system complicit with the underground world of crime.As many similar movies, 'The Batman' deserves praise for the visual concept. We are in a dark universe, where it seems to rain almost permanently, excepting when the dams break and the city is completely flooded. At no time do we have a feeling of warmth or light, more than 95% of the action takes place at night and the darkness dominates, figuratively and literally. The story is too long. Movies that last more than two hours need good justification for their duration, that doesn't exist here, and this film lasts almost three hours. The detective action is not interesting enough, the revelations of the characters behind the masks do not bring extraordinary or unexpected surprises, and the successive passes through cinematic genres (police intrigue, vengeance, catastrophe) is done without elegance. The romantic story is fragile to the point of non-existence. Robert Pattinson, whom I have appreciated a lot in other movies, fails to bring the character behind the mask to life, while Zoë Kravitz fails to make us forget other famous actresses who wore the Catwoman's costume. A more interesting role, in the category of 'actors-made-up-beyond-recognition', is played by Colin Farrell. Delicious but too little. 'The Batman' is one of those movies that I can only recommend to fans of comics-inspired movies and especially to those who love the Batman series and do not want to lose any production in the collection.",im fan movi inspir comic marvel univers parallel imaginari univers overwhelm concern use judg movi believ cinemat genr provid opportun tell interest stori build charact one identifi one energet dislik rais touch univers human theme importantli provid qualiti entertain that right happen le often comicsinspir movi count finger one hand one rememb pleasur still one finger left free todd philip joker origin superman spiderman edit dark knight batman direct matt reev gloomi complic version complex intrigu metropoli gotham fail complet galleri except make last finger usefulim even sure batman version propos movi superhero time movi fli last resort obviou hesit aerial promenad end almost catastroph emerg land ident known almost everyon cours audienc long play role doesnt take mask even kiss that goe comic nemesi riddler vigilant use serial killer method long time situat ambigu moral point view least two seem side good evil script propos complic detect intrigu sprinkl riddl assassin leav scene crime address especi batman catwoman also show parallel person stori two along polic commission gordon fight alon corrupt system complicit underground world crimea mani similar movi batman deserv prais visual concept dark univers seem rain almost perman except dam break citi complet flood time feel warmth light action take place night dark domin figur liter stori long movi last two hour need good justif durat doesnt exist film last almost three hour detect action interest enough revel charact behind mask bring extraordinari unexpect surpris success pas cinemat genr polic intrigu vengeanc catastroph done without eleg romant stori fragil point nonexist robert pattinson appreci lot movi fail bring charact behind mask life zo kravitz fail make u forget famou actress wore catwoman costum interest role categori actorsmadeupbeyondrecognit play colin farrel delici littl batman one movi recommend fan comicsinspir movi especi love batman seri want lose product collect,neutral

Not a great Batman film, but a good one. It was not as good as the Dark Knight trilogy, but it's definitely better than the rest.

721,"I loved this movie. I thought this was a thrilling and entertaining tribute to Batman and the characters surrounding the franchise.Each actor gives a wonderful performance.Zoe Kravitz in my opinion gave the best performance for Catwoman in my opinion, her dynamic with Robert Pattinson was great and the way she carried herself felt organic compared to lets say Halle Berry or Anne Hathaway.Colin Farrell was perfect for the Penguin, I was sceptical when I first heard about the casting but honestly, really surprised me. He and Batman had the most exciting scene in the film in my opinion.As well Serkis, Wright and others, I thought the cast was great.Of course Robert Pattinson nailed Batman, the way he carried the caped crusader character was perfect and he really felt like a threat.However, my first issue comes from the other side of Robert Pattinsons' role as Bruce Wayne. I feel like when you do a superhero on screen with a secret identity, you should attempt to do 50/50 with the hero and the man behind the mask. This movie felt like 90% Batman and 10% Bruce Wayne.I love Batman but I was reallu hoping to see a new side and personality to Bruce Wayne that we haven't seen before. It felt like we barely saw him.Christian Bale gave a great performance as Bruce Wayne. Although Pattinson was still good in the role, he left a lot to be desired.I also felt the Riddler was somewhat disappointing and I think he could have been way better if they lessened the storyline revolving around Carmine Falcone and just stuck with the Penguin if they wanted to do mob stuff.

723,"As a big fan of Robert Pattinson, and as a fan of Batman in general (well, at least the good Batman movies--I LOVE Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy,) I was looking forward to this gritty, mystery-based Batman story. I was hoping that a tone reminiscent of a David Fincher-esque crime thriller would make the film a unique and authentic viewing experience, combined with a hopefully-compelling villain (the Riddler.) Unfortunately, the film did not meet my high expectations. It's certainly not bad, but it leaves more to be desired than one would hope.The film centers on Batman early on in his crime-fighting career, and broadly centers around his attempts to stop the Riddler committing grisly murders of Gotham City elites. The film has some good cinematography and strong production values that elaborately and thoughtfully convey a sense of grit, darkness, and grime in Gotham City. Michael Giacchino's score is also impressive; it is deeply brooding while simultaneously creating a commanding sense of ambition, dread, and atmosphere. Its performances are a bit of a mixed bag. Robert Pattinson is OK as Batman, but his acting style is unfortunately too one-note to most effectively play the part and thus makes his performance a bit underwhelming compared to Christian Bale or even Michael Keaton, for example. Zoë Kravitz does well as Catwoman, providing a more authentic and gritty portrayal of the character than in the past. Paul Dano provides a chilling and eerily realistic portrayal of the Riddler, who can effectively portray the deranged effects of internet radicalization on people. I thought the rest of the cast was generally strong; highlights include Jeffrey Wright as. James Gordon, Collin Farrell as The Penguin, and Andy Serkis as Alfred Pennyworth--although the latter two do not have too much screen time. Yet ""The Batman"" is a film more flawed than I was hoping it would be. First and foremost, the film runs far too long. Unlike the cohesive and superbly well-paced Nolan films, this movie did not need to be 3 hours long, and significant chunks of the second act could have been edited down or made tighter without losing the plot. The pacing can be erratic at times as well, seemingly jumping back and forth between crime thriller, superhero film, and character drama. That may seem like this film tries to be a jack of all trades, but if that was the intention of the writers, they did not succeed. This type of ""serial killer thriller"" has been done much better and more authentically in movies like ""Se7en,"" so even though this film feels that it is being creatively bold by introducing these elements within the constraints of a Batman film, it doesn't manage to do anything new, authentic, or convincing with these elements. The action scenes are mostly forgettable, besides a mid-film Batmobile chase that is fleeting but a ton of fun to watch. Yet what makes the film a mild disappointment is that the stakes involved and attempts at building an emotional core are not done well or integrated fully into the screenplay, making the film seem far less ""whole"" than the best Batman movies.Recommended for theatrical viewing only for big fans of Batman; everyone else can wait to rent or stream it. 6/10.",big fan robert pattinson fan batman gener well least good batman moviesi love christoph nolan dark knight trilog look forward gritti mysterybas batman stori hope tone reminisc david fincheresqu crime thriller would make film uniqu authent view experi combin hopefullycompel villain riddler unfortun film meet high expect certainli bad leav desir one would hopeth film center batman earli crimefight career broadli center around attempt stop riddler commit grisli murder gotham citi elit film good cinematographi strong product valu elabor thought convey sen grit dark grime gotham citi michael giacchino score also impress deepli brood simultan creat command sen ambit dread atmospher perform bit mix bag robert pattinson ok batman act style unfortun onenot effect play part thu make perform bit underwhelm compar christian bale even michael keaton exampl zo kravitz well catwoman provid authent gritti portray charact past paul dano provid chill eerili realist portray riddler effect portray derang effect internet radic peopl thought rest cast gener strong highlight includ jeffrey wright jame gordon collin farrel penguin andi serki alfr pennyworthalthough latter two much screen time yet batman film flaw hope would first foremost film run far long unlik cohes superbl wellpac nolan film movi need hour long signific chunk second act could edit made tighter without lose plot pace errat time well seemingli jump back forth crime thriller superhero film charact drama may seem like film tri jack trade intent writer succeed type serial killer thriller done much better authent movi like seen even though film feel creativ bold introduc element within constraint batman film doesnt manag anyth new authent convinc element action scene mostli forgett besid midfilm batmobil chase fleet ton fun watch yet make film mild disappoint stake involv attempt build emot core done well integr fulli screenplay make film seem far le whole best batman moviesrecommend theatric view big fan batman everyon el wait rent stream,positive

725,"This movie was seriously overhyped. After the awesome works of Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins, how could anyone compete? In this case, they shouldn't even have tried. The story is incredibly boring and illogical. The villain, was just a plain idiot, first claiming he want to punish the ""liars"", but then suddenly wanting to kill everyone, including innocent civilians. Completely illogical. Also this villain suddenly gets ahold of tons and tons of explosives to blow up half the city, after literally whining how poor he is. Makes perfect sense. Not. This movie was just stupid. Watch Batman Begins instead, with an awesome story and a villain, who while certainly is not less evil, at least has some internal logic. This didn't.

726,"The new big screen reboot of DC Comics' iconic superhero by writer and director Matt Reeves has a very promising and strong start, but somewhere in the second half drops the ball hard and struggles to keep the sinking ship floating above the water, not helped in any way by its unnecessarily long runtime.The first half of the movie presents some of the best scenes in the cinematic history of the Caped Crusader, in regard to atmosphere, world building, character relations, and its portrayal of the detective and identity of the titular character. The look and feel of Gotham City were both familiar yet distinctive, a unique environment but not that unrecognizable from everyday life. The incorporation of gritty realism into the world of fantasy was previously attempted by Christopher Nolan in his trilogy of films, here Reeves and company take it to the next level and portray a level of danger that was only briefly touched upon but not explored to its fullest. The occasional horror elements are also applied effectively, creating some genuinely suspenseful and intense moments that will make some movie goers feel uncomfortable. Helping with the mood is the dynamic musical score by Michael Giacchino and wonderful cinematography. Robert Pattinson's portrayal of the iconic hero works well in the context of this particular story, staying true to the concept that Batman is the real identity and Bruce Wayne is the empty shell of a man that is an infringement on his life. I have been reading Batman comic books since the age of seven, and while aspects of Pattinson's portrayal are foreign to me, there are little things that I can appreciate.Other members in the cast are good to serviceable. Jeffrey Wright makes a fine Jim Gordon, Andy Serkis puts a fine stamp on the character of Alfred Pennyworth, Colin Farrell is unrecognizable and a little fun as The Penguin though I am not sure if I would give him a spin-off as has been said to be in the works. John Turturro is excellent as Falcone, so good I wish the marketing made his presence stronger his performance should be talked about more in reviews. Lenny Kravitz and Lisa Bonet's daughter Zoe makes a fine Selina Kyle, she's not very believable in an action role or looks like she could really be very skilled in hand-to-hand combat, but her outfit is certainly more fight ready than, say, Anne Hathaway's in 2012's The Dark Knight Rises. Paul Dano's The Riddler is not The Riddler, in all my years absorbing content related to Batman this version of the character's relations to the source material are strictly in-name-only, they could have been another of Batman's rogues or a completely new character and it wouldn't alter the film's plot whatsoever. Dano is good in the film, but his character is not The Riddler.Where the movie falls apart entirely is halfway in, with a line Catwoman expresses to our hero on the rooftop where the bat signal stands ready to shine into the night sky. It is from that moment on that the fridge has been nuked and it never fully recovers from that. At that point, real world contemporary politics are brought into the picture, and they persist further in sometimes subtle and other time insidious ways. The line in subject, which has been brought up many times right now from others, is not another throwaway line of dialog or to virtue signal but as an expressive marker for the film's subtext and underlying themes. The themes and the subtext in conversation reiterate talking points often seen in the media of our world and there is not-too-subtle biblical reinterpretation lending itself to ideology that ultimately make it a point that this Batman movie is not really about escapism, it's more about a message. How this message will be received time will tell, but I feel the majority of viewers would prefer to see a Batman movie carrying themes and subtext with more subtlety and universality - but I suppose in that regard my expectations might be a bit too high given that Matt Reeves is a Bad Robot alumni and whose friends JJ Abrams and Damon Lindelof like to deconstruct and make many big ""choices"" in their work.That problematic line of dialog and accompanying underlying themes and subtext might not have been that apparent for some people if only the movie's pacing were stronger. At roughly three hours in length, the film's remaining second and entire third half feel very long and tedious. I have seen all Batman movies produced for the screen, and this may be the first time I have ever mindfully asked the question, ""when is the intermission?"" There is a lot going on in the movie, and to be honest some things may have been better off left at the cutting room floor or saved for a director's cut as they derailed the flow of the movie, and all major action beats after felt like loud whispers.The action itself is serviceable but not very impressive, a lot of that is the result of too many quick cuts and close-ups in addition to darkly lit environments which diminish the effect of the spectacle. However, there is not really many action set pieces in this, which some may find to be disappointing.This is not really a 'fun' kind of movie, it's as serious and straight forward as the thrillers it takes inspiration from like Se7en and Zodiac. The storyline is also best consumed by adult viewers, younger viewers not so much, I think the appeal of seeing Batman in live action will lose its wonderment quickly, and they find themselves wanting to consume other material with these characters. I wouldn't recommend a parent take their child to see this movie either due to its mature content and intense scenes, you are probably better off buying them toys from the movie and encourage them to use their imaginations to develop their own Batman narrative with the figures.Could've been great, but as it is it has great moments but is ultimately too long and overindulges itself to the point where it feels a bit pretentious at times.Maybe the sequel will be better, but after leaving the theater I didn't really feel like this world needs much further exploration. I cannot really see Robert Pattinson's Batman going up against a Mr. Freeze or a Bane or a Ra's Al Ghul, or even interact with a Superman or a Wonder Woman.",new big screen reboot dc comic icon superhero writer director matt reev promis strong start somewher second half drop ball hard struggl keep sink ship float water help way unnecessarili long runtimeth first half movi present best scene cinemat histori cape crusad regard atmospher world build charact relat portray detect ident titular charact look feel gotham citi familiar yet distinct uniqu environ unrecogniz everyday life incorpor gritti realism world fantasi previous attempt christoph nolan trilog film reev compani take next level portray level danger briefli touch upon explor fullest occasion horror element also appli effect creat genuin suspens intens moment make movi goer feel uncomfort help mood dynam music score michael giacchino wonder cinematographi robert pattinson portray icon hero work well context particular stori stay true concept batman real ident bruce wayn empti shell man infring life read batman comic book sinc age seven aspect pattinson portray foreign littl thing appreciateoth member cast good servic jeffrey wright make fine jim gordon andi serki put fine stamp charact alfr pennyworth colin farrel unrecogniz littl fun penguin though sure would give spinoff said work john turturro excel falcon good wish market made presenc stronger perform talk review lenni kravitz lisa bonet daughter zoe make fine selina kyle she believ action role look like could realli skill handtohand combat outfit certainli fight readi say ann hathaway dark knight rise paul dano riddler riddler year absorb content relat batman version charact relat sourc materi strictli innameonli could anoth batman rogu complet new charact wouldnt alter film plot whatsoev dano good film charact riddlerwher movi fall apart entir halfway line catwoman express hero rooftop bat signal stand readi shine night sky moment fridg nuke never fulli recov point real world contemporari polit brought pictur persist sometim subtl time insidi way line subject brought mani time right other anoth throwaway line dialog virtu signal express marker film subtext underli theme theme subtext convers reiter talk point often seen medium world nottoosubtl biblic reinterpret lend ideolog ultim make point batman movi realli escap messag messag receiv time tell feel major viewer would prefer see batman movi carri theme subtext subtleti univers suppos regard expect might bit high given matt reev bad robot alumnus whose friend jj abram damon lindelof like deconstruct make mani big choic workthat problemat line dialog accompani underli theme subtext might appar peopl movi pace stronger roughli three hour length film remain second entir third half feel long tediou seen batman movi produc screen may first time ever mind ask question intermiss lot go movi honest thing may better left cut room floor save director cut derail flow movi major action beat felt like loud whispersth action servic impress lot result mani quick cut closeup addit darkli lit environ diminish effect spectacl howev realli mani action set piec may find disappointingthi realli fun kind movi seriou straight forward thriller take inspir like seen zodiac storylin also best consum adult viewer younger viewer much think appeal see batman live action lose wonder quickli find want consum materi charact wouldnt recommend parent take child see movi either due matur content intens scene probabl better buy toy movi encourag use imagin develop batman narr figurescouldv great great moment ultim long overindulg point feel bit pretenti timesmayb sequel better leav theater didnt realli feel like world need much explor realli see robert pattinson batman go mr freez bane ra al ghul even interact superman wonder woman,positive

730,"No spoilersI don't think this is a bad film, I just don't think it is a great Batman film. This movie would be a great Batman comic book, but it isn't a great movie. I have to give this film a second watch.To start off with the positives this movie had amazing visuals. I was completely stunned in areas off it. One critique I have it that the camera should have been more dynamic instead of just pans and static shots.My first issue is with the characters. The relationships between the characters aren't reinforced, even with dialogue. There are also barely any character arcs. We never truly learn about the relationship between Batman and Commissioner Gordon. They just work with each other. There is no depth to their relationship. Another issue is with Bruce and Alfred, with the exception of one or two scenes, we barely learn off their relationship. Selina Kyle is a very 2d character and I personally didn't card about her at all. The riddler was an awesome character, I had a couple issues with him though. The mask hid the fantastic acting and you never understood his motive until the very end.Another issue I had with this film was Batman himself. He did not fight like Batman. He barely used any gadgets. He fought too raw and rarely used the darkness and shadows to his advantage (yes I understand this is his 2nd year). Bruce Wayne also just acted like an emo teenager, even saying the line, ""You're not my dad.""
The ending was very anticlimactic. Nobody truly won. There were also no character arcs like I stated previously. Batman didn't grow as a hero due to this experience nor did anyone.There also weren't any epic shots of Batman on top of a building or whatsoever. That is more of a personal issue though.I have more issues on the topics such as the story structure, the story going to fast, character motivation, and more.The visuals and acting carried this film.

733,"I was looking forward to this film when it hit cinemas and what I got was something decent, but not as great as I was hoping. The aesthetic of Gotham city I found to be appropriate as it is a dirty and grimy environment that emulates the world from the comics. This film utilizes the detective aspect of Batman, which is unlike other adaptations of the character. The filmmaking is good as I can recall a couple of scenes where the intentions were clear and cinematography was on point. The action is also admittedly good, the batmobile chase scene being my favorite set piece in the film. Performances were overall decent with Colin Farell being the standout as the Penguin, surprisingly. Now, I usually don't mind long movies, as long as there is something in them that warrants that kind of runtime (maybe the characters or the story), but in the case of The Batman, I don't think it should've been as long as it was. A few of the writing decisions took me out of the story as well. The biggest problem I have with this film overall is that it overcompensates. Not to insult the movie, I just felt the writers tried to do too much. Some scenes go on longer than they need to to the point where it gets a little tedious and certain actors try harder than they need to. I believe a trimming down to two and a half hours would've benefitted the movie greatly. All in all, a decent comic book film that wasn't as good as it could've been.

743,"Prepare yourself for a different kind of Caped Crusader in ""The Batman"" as a ripped Robert Pattinson dons the cape and cowl. A grave looking Bruce Wayne wonders after two years of crime fighting if he is making a difference. Pattinson's version of Bruce Wayne may be the youngest iteration of The Batman. In fact, he refers to himself as 'Vengeance' rather than Batman and spends more time on crime than climbing the social ladder. Get ready for some heavyweight drama, too. ""Cloverfield"" writer & director Matt Reeves and ""Hunger Games"" co-scripter Peter Craig put Pattinson through the wringer in what amounts to a ""Mad Max"" spin on the Detective Comics hero. Awash in shadowy 1940s film noir lighting, nothing about ""The Batman"" is either lighthearted or romantic. Gotham City is a sinister Sodom and Gomorrah on the eve of a critical mayoral election. This grim murder mystery about byzantine corruption in both the police department and the district attorney's office has a sliver of the sadistic ""Saw"" franchise in its DNA. A nonentity who calls himself 'the Riddler' wants to wash away all that evil with some Old Testament retribution. Meantime, The Batman encounters slinky Selina Kyle, (Zoë Kravitz of ""X-Men: First Class""), aka Catwoman, who is searching for a friend gone missing. Predictably, the Bat and the Cat team up for different reasons to contend with a hazmat clad Riddler who looks nothing like the spandex-clad Jim Carrey in ""Batman Forever"" (1995). Watching this grim, serious-minded melodrama, you'll feel like you're caught in a storm without an umbrella because ""The Batman"" is dark, rainy and ominous. Basically, you'd need a hacksaw to carve the doom-laden atmosphere, especially when it clocks in at 176 marathon minutes. Reeves deliberately takes his time piecing together each part of the puzzling plot without giving away anything. Oscar-winning ""Up"" composer Michael Giacchino's orchestral score heightens both the suspense and sharpens the chills with a variety of musical cues.""The Batman"" feels more like David Fincher's serial killer thriller ""Se7en"" (1995), co-starring Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman, than a luminescent, lightweight, costume-clad crimefighting caper. Mind you, nobody has solved the murders of Thomas and Martha Wayne twenty years before, and the tragedy still clouds Bruce Wayne's psyche. We see this younger version of Bruce suited up more often as The Batman rather than modeling the latest sartorial fashions with a gold digger hanging onto his elbow. Crime preoccupies The Batman, and he has trouble keeping out of trouble with the Gotham City Police. Although he has won the trust and support of Detective Lieutenant James Gordon (Jeffrey Wright of ""No Time to Die""), most of Gordon's skeptical superiors and subordinates regard the Caped Crusader with considerable suspicion. Mind you, the criminal element have even less use for him. Blue collar crooks cringe when the Bat signal illuminates the skies. Mob boss Carmine Falcone (John Turturro of ""The Big Lebowski"") and the Penguin, Oswald Cobblepot (an unrecognizable Colin Farrell of ""Daredevil"") dismiss The Batman as a rank amateur. Carmine knew Bruce Wayne when the latter was a child, but he doesn't suspect the orphaned Wayne is The Batman. Neither does Carmine take Selina Kyle seriously either. Actually, she serves drinks in the Penguin's shady nightclub that serves as a front for Carmine's minions. Rarely do we see The Riddler (a bespectacled Paul Dano of ""Swiss Army Man"") until the last half hour. He doesn't appear very intimidating and that makes him seem twice as intimidating. The Riddler's riddles aren't bright and witty, but dark and dangerous. He has orchestrated a massive maneuver that makes the January 6th riot at the Capitol in Washington, D. C. look like child's play. The huge difference here is writer & director Matt Reeves makes everything appear both plausible and chilling in its audacity. No, extraterrestrials don't enter the fray like in ""Batman Vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice"" (2016) or either version of ""Justice League"" (2017).""The Batman"" begins as a slow burn whodunit as our protagonist assembles clues, but there is no shortage of action. This Batman isn't afraid to tango even when the opposition outnumber him. The harrowing demolition derby freeway chase through Gotham City with The Batman hauling butt after the Penguin is a genuine showstopper. The new, stripped-down, Batmobile muscle car looks nothing like any earlier incarnations of the renowned vehicle. Indeed, this Batmobile has a predatory appearance. Interestingly enough, The Batman relies on his trusty Bat motorcycle to zip from here to there with his cape fluttering in the breeze. Reeves doesn't dwell on many Batman gadgets like a James Bond thriller. While Reeves and Craig are more focused on narrative realism, they equip our hero with some clever gadgets. For example, the smart contact lenses with built-in cameras that recognize and identify people are extraordinary. Occasionally, things don't always work out as smoothly for our hero as he expects them. The scene where The Batman BASE jumps from a skyscraper at night to elude capture goes awry when he deploys his parachute too early. Reeves and Craig surround Pattinson with a sterling cast of infamous characters, and they put the Caped Crusader into some predicaments he cannot get out of even with his gadgetry. Unlike previous incarnations of Batman, Pattinson will have the chance to age in the role, because Warner Brothers has signed him up for a trilogy. He has the tenacity of Michael Keaton's Batman, the guile of Christian Bale's Batman, but he lacks the brawn of Ben Affleck's Batman. Nevertheless, in his freshman outing, Pattinson looks like he has gotten off on the right foot.

744,"It was a bit long and every minute was in near complete darkness. Some good acting with Pattinson doing a vocal take on Bale and Affleck . Somehow, and I know it's all stunt work, Batman faded in and out of being a total kick ass and the gadgetry was pretty minimal which I missed. I see no need for a sequel to this iteration of Batman. Music was derivative from a number of sources and the and I guess I should watch it again ( yuck) to get more substance. SPOLIER !!! The ending had about a million deaths and was not even a glimmer of hope in sight. It's way long and the action sequences at the end are long , unexciting and anticlimactic. The villain was plain out lame. Zoe Kravitz, all 80 pounds of her, is tremendously appealing visually but not a very good actress as The Catwoman.

I don't know much about Pattinson (I'm too old to care about those kid movies of his) but I though he brought an edge, both physically and emotionally to this version of the endless story. Also, the villains while having the names we are familiar with, are more conventional in appearance, without the costuming we have come to expect. This is a big movie with examples of mob rule feasting on Gotham City. We also have Batman dealing with mysteries concerning his father and mother. There are some rather endless scenes of violent confrontations and car chases. But pacing needed to be adjusted and it needed to get to the point.

751,"My favorite film of all time for many years has been The Dark Knight, it pushed the boundaries of what a comic book movie could be, taking inspiration from The Long Halloween, it showed that these characters could work in the guise of different genres. But as much as I love the Dark Knight I've always wanted a horror Batman film, and this film gave that to me, well, it has horror elements, it's not a full fleshed horror film, but this was extremely satisfying.Pattinson is Batman, from his first scene you can tell that he gets this character in a way no other actor has (Christian Bale it's still my favorite Batman, but that's also because he got to play all the parts, the Playboy Bruce Wayne, the real Bruce Wayne, and Batman). Just the way he moves, the way he looks, you get a lot of information from every little movement as to who is this guy, what's he thinking. I didn't saw Robert Pattinson, I saw Batman, and for the first time ever he's not overshadowed by his villains.The rest of the cast is stellar, loved Zoe Kravitz's Selina, her scenes with Batman look straight out of the page. Jeffrey Wright is also great as James Gordon, I loved that he was a real partner to Batman. Paul Dano was creepy as hell, his take on the Riddler was perfect for this more noir take on the characters. But the scene stealer was Colin Farrell's Penguin, he transforms into the character, the makeup was amazing, Oscar worthy.The 3 hour runtime has been a point of contention, I'm more in the camp that loved the length of the film, it's extremely refreshing that a modern film with an established character allows itself to take it's time to let scenes breathe, especially since this is a detective film in which Batman will be doing a lot of investigating. The tone was also perfect, it captures Gotham in a way that's never been seen on screen, you believe that in a place like that a guy would dress up as a bat to fight against the criminal element.Technically this film is in other league, Matt Reeves and cinematographer Greg Fraiser created a gorgeous movie, the lighting, the scene blocking, it a visual treat that the academy can't overlook come awards season. There's an artistry to every little scene that hasn't been seen in the genre since Christopher Nolan's trilogy ended, Reeves put in a lot of care into constructing this movie, nothing is arbitrary, nothing is an accident, this a well made film, and especial enfasis on film, since this works as it's own thing.As you can see, I'm extremely satisfied by The Batman, it gave me everything I've ever wanted to see, it treated the material with care, this was the complete vision of a director that keeps delivering quality films that focus on the human element instead of spectacle, which it does have, but unlike Marvel films that have started to feel interchangeable, Reeves never loses focus about it's characters and the story he's trying to tell.This is truly a breathe of fresh air for the genre, and one that hopefully will inspire Marvel and DC to experiment more with their characters. The superhero genre needs to change if it wants to avoid audience burnout, films like The Batman should be the gold standard for this genre which has gave us gems like Logan, Spider-Man 2, into the Spider Verse, Batman Begins, and of course the still undefeated The Dark Knight.

755,"Reading through these reviews, it's clear to me that many people simply don't understand the hype with this movie. A couple things to note: Yes, the movie is extremely long (3hrs) and yes it moves at a very slow pace. For this reason I feel most people simply won't like it when other superhero flicks are packed with a steady storytelling method that moves the plot forward on a consistent time scale and enough action to get their heart racing.This version of Batman is done very differently. This prefers the story and the sensation of something lingering just out of sight in order to create an impending sense of doom. This is a far more serious movie than it's predecessors, foregoing the generic comedy bites to keep the mood light enough to prime the audience for the next action sequence.This feels more grounded than most other hero movies and this version of Batman even makes sense in a way, feeding you a tortured soul that walks a line between good and bad.Now, what makes this movie truly standout is the cinematography. The filmmakers choose to use the camera to tell the story and limit the amount of digital graphics or CGI in the film. This shows a real passion for cinematography and because of this, the quality of the film will hold up longer than those films leaning heavily on CGI. A great example of this is how the original Matrix cinematography surpasses all 3 of the sequels in visual integrity due to the camera angles and not the graphics.This Batman certainly isn't for everyone and that is okay, but the people giving this such poor reviews, I can only assume require instant gratification and don't much care whether the image on the screen is real or rendered.TLDR: Be patient and appreciate the art and storytelling that went into this film.

756,It's really hard not to compare this to the dark Knight. They are both dark and very serious takes on the caped crusader. However the fast pace coupled with iconic scenes of the Dark Knight made that dark take work. The Batman however felt like an overly stretched two part episode of Batman the Animated Series. The pace is very slow and there are no iconic scenes in my opinion. It is very reminiscent of Seven and Zodiac in themes and plot but are comparably lacklustre in execution. That being said everything else is good and if you are a fan of Batman it is still worth checking out but I'd wait for it to pop up on streaming so you can watch it in parts and not get bored.Note: It is not worth staying past the credits.,realli hard compar dark knight dark seriou take cape crusad howev fast pace coupl icon scene dark knight made dark take work batman howev felt like overli stretch two part episod batman anim seri pace slow icon scene opinion reminisc seven zodiac theme plot compar lacklustr execut said everyth el good fan batman still worth check id wait pop stream watch part get borednot worth stay past credit,neutral

762,"This in no way was a bad movie. Just a tad underwhelming. I went into this movie expecting some big Batman action, mixed with some detective work and a bit of mystery. Instead what I got was a Batman film that was more mystery then action. Not to say there wasn't great action in it, but it definitely took the back seat to the overall mystery. That is my first gripe with this movie. For a film that seems to be diving headfirst into the detective side of Batman, the mystery seemed half baked and underwhelming. Batman doesn't solve the case, it's pretty much spelled out for him. I liked how Bruce was still figuring out how to be the Batman, but he's supposed to have the skills first and the image later. Instead this Batman stumbles around any fight he's in, resulting in shots, punches, bombs and more hitting him point blank. Not that any of this hurts him, somehow his suit is resistant to every attack to his body. Miraculously, his exposed mouth and jaw are always in perfect shape though.This movie really shines through its character work. Bruce Wayne/Batman is great. Pattinson does a great job as a Bruce who isn't quite Batman yet. He is dark, emotional, and honestly quite scary to watch. His Alfred, played by Andy Serkis, was great as well. Through his limited screen time he portrayed a strong Alfred with a clear past in the military. Catwoman, played by Zoe Kravitz, was amazing as well. The best catwoman we've got on TV or Film yet. Colin Farell was unrecognizable as Penguin, and portrayed the character in a way that was almost exactly like the comics. Last but not least, Paul Dano ad Riddler. Riddler was terrifying, and maybe the best Batman villain on screen so far. He was amazing as a life-like serial killer that was great when juxtaposed to the Batman.Although I did have some complaints, I think The Batman mostly succeeds as what it set out to do. The sequel has the potential to improve greatly on what we have and become the best Batman series we've got so far.

763,"So Patterson as Batman... I wasn't exactly concerned. But the news, that. He refused to work out (and buff up) - was more a bummer...But hey.- Reeves is a good Director and they will make a great movie...A good movie it is. But it wasn't (at all) a Batman movie. It would have been probably infinitely better, if Reeves would have made the movie from the Riddler perspective. In fact, it sounds like a fantastic idea, to make a movie which is from the ""Batman prey"" perspective. A lot of criticism I have might have disappeared...Anyway lets just talk about the great stuff: the cinematography is fantastic. Everything is cut perfectly, the color gamut is broody and great, the costumes (maybe except of the Batsuit?), the scenery. All has been done fantastic.Even better was the Riddler. I must say, I haven't been especially impressed with his ""costume"". It works, but there is no real context. But overall the Riddler is fantastic - and at a certain scene he is for sure dominating a scene with Batman. Absolutely great.Oh - the Penguin as crime bossling. Great stuff. Colin Ferrel really hit hart with his portrayal. It is one of the roles, which were absolutely mesmerizing, because it was not Colin.. it was the Penguin. Probably next to ""Les Grossman"" (Tom Cruise) in Tropic Thunder, one of the best conformations.Zoey Kravitz has been also fantastic. Not a typical role as Catwoman - a far more grounded version. She is sexy without being over the top. Strong without being unrealistic. Great stuff.Felix Leiter - sorry Commissioner Gordon is also great. Maybe for few minutes a bit awkward but overall fantastic.And even Patterson was good. A bit emo - but in some scenes he really could really show the pain he endured due to the death of his parents. Maybe in this moments, he would be better than any other Bruce Wayne before.The story - it is not another amajgeddon - it is ""just a believable"" terror attack by a psychopath. This is also believable for me.So why only 6/10?Let's start with the last point: I had the feeling, that the story was a bit too much borrowed of the Zodiac Killer mixed with Saw. Lacked a bit originality.Also: Batman supposed to be the ""best detective"" here. But really he isn't. The scene which I have talked about above: Where Riddler confronted Batman, that he overestimated him? I had exactly the same feeling. It seemed that Batman was pretty good in solving ""riddles"" - but not really a good detective at all. He exactly followed the path what Riddle laid out for him.Another thing: strength, weaknesses, power-scaling - lets face it: the Patterson Batman would be already dead: there is no particular gadgets (...) of his suit, which can explain, why dominates. He also doesn't show a particular fighting style, strength or craftiness when fighting. He is also not smart when interacting with his environment... what do I mean? The Bale Batman had gadgets and Ninja training. The Affleck Batman was more brawn - but had also gadgets and used the element of surprise (sans the ninja). Even the Keaton Batman had the same combination of surprise and gadgets.Patterson is walking into the scene. It is just not believable. Especially as he is just a twig. This apex' in the scene, where he is affected by Riddlers bomb!The Batmobile is equally nonsensical. It seems to be a rather good idea (sans the jet engine) as a Baja racer. But for urban ""car chases""? What were they thinking?At the end the narrative of this movie (every criminal is afraid, when they see the batsignal) and the movie reality don't come together.If he disrupts crime, why don't the criminals not just get him into a trap? This Batman would have no chance to get out of it.Maybe Patterson was more a ""Domino Batman"" (Lucky Girl from Deadpool)?But this is not really the batman I want to see.What though made it even worse is the lack of connection between Gothams state and the corruption of the wealthy. All was there in front of our eyes. But the conclusion hasn't been presented. I was hopeful - maybe in any way the movie just showed us, that the system is bad - capitalism is bad (...) - but when we almost could smell this conclusion, Reeves pulled the rug away from under our feet and concluded: Riddler crazy, Batman good, oh - and a Joker is coming.The last point is maybe the most upsetting point. Maybe Bruce Wayne could have become the real hero.

765,"Not really what I was expecting. The trailer along with the directors comments about the project made it seem like they were aiming for a ""detective"" style Batman. Reminiscent of the Batman found in graphic novels like The Long Halloween and Hush. I was really excited about that, especially when the movie Seven had been mentioned several times as an inspiration for the film. In a sense I guess we got that element in Batman 2022? But we also got a bunch of other, less interesting stuff.The movie is simply too long. It's packed with subplots that make the film kind of confusing. All the different subplots and elements also disrupt the pacing of the film and made me feel like I was watching three different movies at once.There's the ""Seven"" type thriller about Batman, Gordon, Catwoman and the Riddler. Here we get some really great scenes with amazingly choreographed violence. The Riddlers first murder is messy and terrifying. Not your typical Hollywood murder that looks all smooth and cool. These scenes are few however and mostly found in the first 40 min of the film. After that it's like the studio took a look and was like NOPE, NOT NOLAN ENOUGH.Because after that, it gets this Nolan-esque theme of chaos and terror, with a watered down version of Heath ledger's joker. Paul Dino is a really good actor but he really overdoes it with Riddler in this one. He comes off more silly than intimidating. I thought he was going to be all silent, scary and a literal psycho. Instead he's a whiny incel.The terror attacks at the end really made it feel like The Dark Knight Rises. There are really similar themes to the attacks in TDKR and the Riddlers motives are basically the same as Banes.Then there's the subplot about Bruce and his relationship to his parents. It's just not interesting enough. So what if his father wasn't a perfect guy. It just seems so stupid that the freaking master detective Batman never even googled his parents and found out about their very public ""secrets"". He's supposed to be the worlds greatest detective!Not a terrible film. It had its moments. Not the detective story I was hoping for though.

767,"After seeing this latest version of the Caped Crusader which has been around in comic books since 1939, I thought that this epic take on Batman was a bit darker than Batman V Superman yet can't reach the peakness that was The Dark Knight, released during a time when there was no pandemic and interest was high after Heath Ledger died. The film takes place durin Batman's young adult years, skipping when Bruce's parents were murdered and jumping straight into the action and drama. Among the friends and fiends he faces are the Catwoman, the Penguin, and The Riddler, not to mention The Joker at the very end of the movie which paves way for a sequel which might happen given that this movie is doing quite well at the box office despite high ticket prices at chains like AMC and Regal. Watch it in Imax or Dolby and enjoy the great score by Michael Giacchino. The cinematography is very dark and can be bright during rave scenes. Sound mix is very good and the action is very real.

However, the previous Batman, although great in their own right, felt as though something was missing. Pattinson, however actually felt like a young Batman from the comics.

772,"When it was announced that the next actor to play Batman would be Robert Pattinson, I was one of many who thought ""this is going to be a disaster"". But, one thing this IP has proven time and again is sometimes a casting choice that sounds terrible can turn out to be perfect. More on Pattinson in a moment, but for now, I will say The Batman never fails to entertain. For a film that's three hours long, it's mostly well paced, finding a good balance between story and action. It only really starts to feel its length in the conclusion, and even then, just barely. The mystery at the center of the plot is well written, does a good job of both keeping you guessing and showing Batman's talents as a detective, and has some great surprises along the way. And there are some memorable, even funny, lines scattered throughout.As someone who was outraged to learn Edward Cullen would be playing Batman, I was relieved to see that I was pleasantly surprised by Pattinson. In fact, he's easily the best actor to play the role since Keaton, finding the perfect balance between the character's cool moments and his emotional moments. He also thankfully changes his voice between Batman and Bruce Wayne just enough that it doesn't sound like the same person, unlike George Clooney, but not so much that it sounds goofy, like Christian Bale. The rest of the cast is great too. Zoe Kravitz makes for an enjoyable Catwoman. Paul Dano, Colin Farrell, and John Turturro are perfectly over the top as the villains. And the rest of the cast shines as well.The fight scenes are everything you could ask for in a modern action movie: well shot, welll edited, well staged, and well choreographed. You feel every blow Batman delivers whenever he hits someone. The highlight of the action however is easily the car chase with the Penguin halfway through. It's almost as good as the one in The Dark Knight. Meanwhile, Gotham City is well presented here. The editing, lighting, and color scheme (mainly a lot of different hues of red) do a great job of presenting us with a city pretty much constantly on the brink. The sound design is great; you really feel the weight of Batman's cool looking armor when he moves. And the music is top notch too. Batman's theme is much simpler and less bombastic than in previous films, fitting given the character's status as a novice. And the choice of Ave Maria as the Riddler's theme adds a creep value that perfectly suits the character. Seriously, I don't think I can ever hear that song the same way again.Overall, if The Batman was shorter, it would easily top the 1989 film. As it is, it's just barely below that one and The Dark Knight. But, that doesn't make it any less of an awesome movie that I can't recommend enough. It's too bad the sequel has been delayed, but given Warner Bros' reecent track record, I'm just glad it wasn't cancelled.",announc next actor play batman would robert pattinson one mani thought go disast one thing ip proven time sometim cast choic sound terribl turn perfect pattinson moment say batman never fail entertain film that three hour long mostli well pace find good balanc stori action realli start feel length conclus even bare mysteri center plot well written good job keep guess show batman talent detect great surpris along way memor even funni line scatter throughouta someon outrag learn edward cullen would play batman reliev see pleasantli surpris pattinson fact he easili best actor play role sinc keaton find perfect balanc charact cool moment emot moment also thank chang voic batman bruce wayn enough doesnt sound like person unlik georg clooney much sound goofi like christian bale rest cast great zoe kravitz make enjoy catwoman paul dano colin farrel john turturro perfectli top villain rest cast shine wellth fight scene everyth could ask modern action movi well shot welll edit well stage well choreograph feel everi blow batman deliv whenev hit someon highlight action howev easili car chase penguin halfway almost good one dark knight meanwhil gotham citi well present edit light color scheme mainli lot differ hue red great job present u citi pretti much constantli brink sound design great realli feel weight batman cool look armor move music top notch batman theme much simpler le bombast previou film fit given charact statu novic choic ave maria riddler theme add creep valu perfectli suit charact serious dont think ever hear song way againoveral batman shorter would easili top film bare one dark knight doesnt make le awesom movi cant recommend enough bad sequel delay given warner bro reecent track record im glad wasnt cancel,positive

774,"The movie is not bad, some of the performances were incredibly entertaining (the penguin stole the show) and some parts were very good. But it just never comes together.Robert Pattinson does a good job as Batman. The Riddler is good but not great and Gordon is average at best. Cat woman is also good but not one of them save for the penguin is particularly memorable.The whole Bat sign in the sky making dark corners of the city terrifying for criminals was incredibly well done but then almost immediately undercut by the amount of time Batman spends out in the open. Even going to a crime scene. It is the crime scene... scene that summarizes what is wrong with this film. Batman is a terrifying figure in the shadows, seeing him at a crime scene with a bunch of cops highlights how ludicrous the whole thing is. Especially considering his age, he just looks like an emo dude in a playing dress up in a ridiculous costume trying to fight crime.In Burton's Batman and Nolan's Batman films he is a mysterious shadow and a bogeyman to the criminals. Here he looks like a more skilled and better equipped version of an overzealous neighbourhood watch dude.The action scenes are fun. The story is entertaining enough and the actors, while they don't knock it out of the park in no way have a negative impact so it is enjoyable. But the monster in the closet is a lot scarier and intimidating when you only see glimpses. These guys turned on the light and invited him in.(Also, this may be just me but, can they hire some characters whose voices aren't tortured and deep?

780,"This new iteration of the Batman mythos starts with a Batman just a couple of years into his reign. The time is similar to that of the Nolan trilogy but darker and perhaps more grounded but what I like most about this iteration is that it's a detective story that doesn't rely on action.Robert Pattinson is great as Batman/ Bruce Wayne but my favourite performance was Colin Farrell as The Penguin. Most of the rest of the top notch cast were great too with the exception of Andy Serkis as Alfred whose take was all wrong and Paul Dano was very hit and miss as The Riddler (More miss).Now on to the major issues that stopped this from being my favourite Batman film. Firstly the cinematography is too dark even for Batman films, it's quite eye straining a lot of the time and is nowhere as gorgeous as other dark toned films from the same director. The film is constantly very dark and wet but whereas something like Blade Runner is still crisp with east to see detail, this one just often feels too dark.

Not sure he is a great Batman, feels young even though Christian bale was a few years younger than him when he played Batman. You don't get much Bruce Wayne time and you need that to care about Batman. It's a bit long too.. very weird that it feels like very little character development in a 3 hour movie. Best thing was Colin Farrell but you don't see enough of him. Music is good, Gotham is good but the movie is also nearly too realistic.

But after some time I collected my thoughts and here they are.First of all the movie is awesome. It's something I can't remember seeing in superhero movies. Yes there are details that were brought from Fincher and Nolan and some others. But it feels like it has its own unique world, different from its predecessors.The actors performance is superb.Although the movie is supposed to be a neo noir detective, a lot of mysteries Batman uncovers not through analysing, investigating or putting up clues together but by getting exposition(talking) from characters he visits.Overall the screenplay feels raw, and editing unfinished. Like the studio was rushing with it. There are a lot of meaningless shots that make the movie way too long.So in conclusion despite the new vision of Batman and the DC Universe and gripping atmosphere alongside wonderful acting the movie suffers from flawed plot and editing.",leav theatr thought mostli compris man movi awesom scari cool wow time collect thought arefirst movi awesom someth cant rememb see superhero movi ye detail brought fincher nolan other feel like uniqu world differ predecessorsth actor perform superbalthough movi suppos neo noir detect lot mysteri batman uncov analys investig put clue togeth get expositiontalk charact visitsoveral screenplay feel raw edit unfinish like studio rush lot meaningless shot make movi way longso conclus despit new vision batman dc univers grip atmospher alongsid wonder act movi suffer flaw plot edit,neutral

804,"Batman (2022) was a reset of the Batman saga literally from the top with a lengthy epic length of almost 3 hours long. The first screen version of Batman was a TV series, a duet with a Boy Wonder sidekick which dated back to the 60's. That was a squeaky-clean version of ""POW!"" and ""KAPOW!"" knockouts of the bad guys. A superhero ""super"" because he and Boy Wonder were the accompaniments to maintaining law and order, which was suggestively beyond the arms of the Gotham police. As time progresses, the movie version of Batman took an interim turn to become bigger, with more fantastic super-toys, to the point where he had outgrown the need of Robin the Boy Wonder to become ""super"" solo on his own. A design needed to offset some equally more diabolical and more showy ""super"" villains. At that time, Gotham was still simplistically polar in its good vs. Bad, but as our real world evolved into more and more complex and dualistic sophistry of relativism, Gotham also evolved accordingly. Batman becomes the Dark Knight. No longer is he the Adam West version. Now he has a dark spot in his heart, and vengeance in his drive for justice. Who cares if he is not puritanically good as long as he shines over the darkness of greater evil? In this latest version, the line between good and evil has become even less distinguishable. It has become a question of who between Batman and the Riddler is the more acceptable vigilante? A question of who can claim the moral higher ground, a question which was also asked in the movie ""Seven"". As a movie, Robert Pattison makes a visually compelling Batman to look at, in spite of the short fall in the script. For as a character, he was written with the depth of a cardboard standee. The direction did not help by giving him a lot of brooding closeups as if by abundance, we can actually see depth into Batman's soul. One peculiar nuance with this new version is Batman is being demystified to become a more common mortal, like the Paul Kersey character in those Death Wish movies for Batman is able to walk among the police of Gotham like Sherlock Holmes could among his bobbies. He is no longer the revered ""dark knight"" but the weird ""vengeance"" guy in a funny costume. Someone whom the police can barely tolerate. Also, new to this is the mystery of his true identity. It is a secret seemingly more important to Bruce than to others. The general curiosity in the matter among people seems perfunctorily halfhearted. My favorite parts in the movie are the detective style of storytelling, especially at the opening. Some of the fight scenes are also quite spectacular and finally, the kit out, stripped down, quasi stock racer of a bat mobile with that bad ass jet engine so exposed as the flaming butt hole of the car. The rawness and the attainableness of the whole design is just delightful.",batman reset batman saga liter top lengthi epic length almost hour long first screen version batman tv seri duet boy wonder sidekick date back squeakyclean version pow kapow knockout bad guy superhero super boy wonder accompani maintain law order suggest beyond arm gotham polic time progress movi version batman took interim turn becom bigger fantast supertoy point outgrown need robin boy wonder becom super solo design need offset equal diabol showi super villain time gotham still simplist polar good v bad real world evolv complex dualist sophistri relativ gotham also evolv accordingli batman becom dark knight longer adam west version dark spot heart vengeanc drive justic care puritan good long shine dark greater evil latest version line good evil becom even le distinguish becom question batman riddler accept vigilant question claim moral higher ground question also ask movi seven movi robert pattison make visual compel batman look spite short fall script charact written depth cardboard stande direct help give lot brood closeup abund actual see depth batman soul one peculiar nuanc new version batman demystifi becom common mortal like paul kersey charact death wish movi batman abl walk among polic gotham like sherlock holm could among bobbi longer rever dark knight weird vengeanc guy funni costum someon polic bare toler also new mysteri true ident secret seemingli import bruce other gener curio matter among peopl seem perfunctorili halfheart favorit part movi detect style storytel especi open fight scene also quit spectacular final kit strip quasi stock racer bat mobil bad as jet engin expo flame butt hole car raw attain whole design delight,neutral
805,"First time in my life I left the theater while watching a DC or Marvel movie. I have seen The Dark Knight in IMAX theather when it first came out. It was marvelous, I still remember how it felt to see some of the scenes on IMAX. Therefore I went to see this on IMAX on a huge screen with high quality audio. However, this one adopts traditional filming techniques. No crisp and mind bending visuals here, merely 90s thriller. This could have been easily released on streaming services because you don't need big screen for this. It would make much easier to watch 180 minutes movie.On the other hand I noticed that some people compare this with Se7en but it's nowhere close to it. Here we have a Batman whose IQ is 180 or something. Almost all Riddlar puzzles are being solved in seconds by him. I didn't know Bruce Wayne is known by his detective skills. He's just a rich guy, invests his entire wealth to build high tech gadgets to solve puzzles and beat his enemies. Also this Batman doesn't have that fearful look. He's just a person looks like came out of a Halloween party. No intimidation at all.Clearly director tried to pull off what Joker (2019) did. Create an ordinary character out of flesh and blood instead of a fantasy character. Yes, it beautifully worked with Joker but this is completely different. Especially certain Riddlar scenes were terrible. Actor pushed it too hard to play a psycho. Plus, some of his actions reminded me Heath Ledger's joker. Zoe is beautiful, she's acting alright but this is not Catwoman movie (I prefer Anna Hathaway version with her self-confident persona) , it is called The Batman. What I expect is to see proper character development on Batman before everything. It doesn't matter we all know the story. This is a reboot and we have a new actor in our hand.Long story short, this is just a wannabe movie. I read an article before seeing it. The director said to Nolan that he'll make a better movie than Dark Knight. I knew it was not possible to do it in post-2013 era (Woke), even Nolan cannot do it again. But I had hopes honestly. Movie simply didn't make me attached to any character around 70 minutes mark and I had no intention to see the rest. Because I knew that there was still another 110 minutes ahead of me. Maybe I'll look into it when it comes to streaming services. Yet I don't look forward to it.I must say that 10/10 reviews are either trolls or people haven't seen good movies before (or no movies other than dc/marvel). A movie above 8/10 would suck you in right from the beginning while this one couldn't do it even after an hour.Edit: Finally watched the entire movie. It took 3 days but finished it. I think the main issue here is editing. Movie cannot maintain the excitement, if there is any, and 3 hours duration doesn't help. Such a borefest and third act doesn't change this fact. Actually even in the third act there were certain annoying moments but I don't want to give spoilers. That being said I won't change my score, it's still a 6. However, I must admit that Paul Dano does a fair job with Riddlar even though certain scenes and actions remind me Heath Ledger's Joker.",first time life left theater watch dc marvel movi seen dark knight imax theather first came marvel still rememb felt see scene imax therefor went see imax huge screen high qualiti audio howev one adopt tradit film techniqu crisp mind bend visual mere thriller could easili releas stream servic dont need big screen would make much easier watch minut movieon hand notic peopl compar seen nowher close batman whose iq someth almost riddlar puzzl solv second didnt know bruce wayn known detect skill he rich guy invest entir wealth build high tech gadget solv puzzl beat enemi also batman doesnt fear look he person look like came halloween parti intimid allclearli director tri pull joker creat ordinari charact flesh blood instead fantasi charact ye beauti work joker complet differ especi certain riddlar scene terribl actor push hard play psycho plu action remind heath ledger joker zoe beauti she act alright catwoman movi prefer anna hathaway version selfconfid persona call batman expect see proper charact develop batman everyth doesnt matter know stori reboot new actor handlong stori short wannab movi read articl see director said nolan hell make better movi dark knight knew possibl post era woke even nolan hope honestli movi simpli didnt make attach charact around minut mark intent see rest knew still anoth minut ahead mayb ill look come stream servic yet dont look forward iti must say review either troll peopl havent seen good movi movi dcmarvel movi would suck right begin one couldnt even houredit final watch entir movi took day finish think main issu edit movi maintain excit hour durat doesnt help borefest third act doesnt chang fact actual even third act certain annoy moment dont want give spoiler said wont chang score still howev must admit paul dano fair job riddlar even though certain scene action remind heath ledger joker,positive

811,"I'll just get it off my chest, I think The Batman is an exceptional movie. This is what I wish more comic book movies would look like, you can almost feel the thickness of the air in Gotham, very claustrophobic when it needs to be. It's cinematography is absolutely beautiful, this ACTUALLY looks like a modern blockbuster with a 100M+ Budget.Yes I think this is the best on screen Batman, not Bruce Wayne, I need to see more of Robert Pattinson out of the cowl to see if he can best Christian Bale's charisma. But Batman, the voice, the investigative side, down to the very body movement just screams what I consider to be the perfect characterization for Batman.Having an arc of wanting to become more than Vengeance as we saw at the beginning of the movie, but a hero, inspired and become hope, is something I'll forever love this movie for.This is one hell of a cast, filled with talent, I'm not at all ashamed though say that I believe Zoë Kravitz is the best Catwoman we've had in live action. She's on screen just enough to not make her an annoying character and her connection with Carmine Falcone perfectly overarches the main story. Jeffrey Wright is a very good Jim Gordon, he fits greatly paired with Batman like a good cop bad cop duo, and even Andy Serkis as Alfred had a great effect on me in the hospital scene despite not that much screen time.I can't go without mentioning how good the villains were. John Turturro as Carmine Falcone was very underrated, I was very disappointed on how he was barely even mentioned in many reviews. Now of course the bigger talking points would be Colin Farrell as Penguin and Paul Dano as Riddler. Colin Farrell is absolutely unrecognizable, it is insane how good he looked. But Paul Dano was the big one, once again he gives an amazing performance and I love how Riddler was Modernized, even taking inspirations from the Zodiac Killer.But, there's a huge but coming, although the movie does fairly well with its long runtime, I don't think it works very well in the final act. This is a long movie, with a mystery behind it as Batman opens the letters left by Riddler leaving clues as to what's going to happen next. This is played very well with good pacing up until the end, I think I reached a point where I wanted the movie to get to the final stage already but there was still quite a big chunk left, things could've wrapped up a bit quicker in my opinion.By far the most intense part of the movie was the interrogation. I really love how this is played out like Riddler knows Batman's identity, it is soooo well done. This all works because of Riddler's initial motivations, an orphan who feels wronged because of what was promised to him as a child only to be stripped away by the corrupt that run the city, and now to put on a mask and seek his vengeance. I love when the idea of the hero inspires the villain to come out of the shadows comes into play, specially when it's done so well like it is here. Although I really enjoyed the deleted scene with Barry Keoghan as Joker, I'm glad it was left out of the movie because it would taken away from such a great scene.",ill get chest think batman except movi wish comic book movi would look like almost feel thick air gotham claustrophob need cinematographi absolut beauti actual look like modern blockbust budgety think best screen batman bruce wayn need see robert pattinson cowl see best christian bale charisma batman voic investig side bodi movement scream consid perfect character batmanhav arc want becom vengeanc saw begin movi hero inspir becom hope someth ill forev love movi forthi one hell cast fill talent im asham though say believ zo kravitz best catwoman weve live action she screen enough make annoy charact connect carmin falcon perfectli overarch main stori jeffrey wright good jim gordon fit greatli pair batman like good cop bad cop duo even andi serki alfr great effect hospit scene despit much screen timei cant go without mention good villain john turturro carmin falcon underr disappoint bare even mention mani review cours bigger talk point would colin farrel penguin paul dano riddler colin farrel absolut unrecogniz insan good look paul dano big one give amaz perform love riddler modern even take inspir zodiac killerbut there huge come although movi fairli well long runtim dont think work well final act long movi mysteri behind batman open letter left riddler leav clue what go happen next play well good pace end think reach point want movi get final stage alreadi still quit big chunk left thing couldv wrap bit quicker opinionbi far intens part movi interrog realli love play like riddler know batman ident soooo well done work riddler initi motiv orphan feel wrong promis child strip away corrupt run citi put mask seek vengeanc love idea hero inspir villain come shadow come play special done well like although realli enjoy delet scene barri keoghan joker im glad left movi would taken away great scene,positive

Batman uses the waitress of a notorious club, Selina Kyle (Zoë Kravitz), to obtain hidden information that affect many prominent people in Gotham City's society and following the riddles of the villain ""The Riddler"".""The Batman"" is an overhyped, too long, melodramatic and boring movie of the hero created in 1939 by Bob Kane.

Now Batman has existential crisis, is not funny and is performed by Robert Pattinson, who is a good actor but not for this genre. The plot is also melodramatic developed in slow pace becoming boring during almost three hours running time. The caricatural Penguin from the comics become the mobster Oz. The guy destroys dozens of vehicles, certainly killing people in the explosions, and is not arrested. The only nostalgic moment is when the film turns into a disaster film from the 70's. Hard to understand is the hype promoted by some puppets from the studios and ""critics"" about this overrated film.

819,"I went to go see ""The Batman"" early for the IMAX Fan First event and it just blew my mind! The best way I can describe it is that it was ""The Dark Knight"" Trilogy meets detective crime drama meets psychological horror movie. I love how everything connects too. The casting was perfect! Robert Pattinson was an awesome Batman and he and Zoë Kravitz had amazing chemistry together. Paul Dano's Riddler lit up the screen whenever he appeared and he was a great villain. Honestly, the most underrated part of this movie has to be Colin Farrell's Penguin. The makeup team did an amazing job with him and whenever he was onscreen, you couldn't see Colin Farrell, all you saw was Penguin. Jeffery Wright's Jim Gordon and Andy Serkis' Alfred were pretty good as well. The visuals are spectacular and I really do love the creative vision that Matt Reeves had for this movie. Also, the whole theater (myself included) freaked out when they teased Barry Keoghan as Joker near the end of the movie. The whole thing was just too good to put into words. And as shocking as this is, this might actually be better than ""The Dark Knight"", which before seeing this was my favorite movie of all time.

820,"This might be the Darkest Knight yet. And while it is different, all the shoe-gazing does weigh the movie down.Every character is intentionally one-dimensional, lacking any sense of duality. It has to be this way for the overall theme of comparing the origins and motivations of Riddler and Batman. But again, it is so heavy-handed and dire, is it all that much of a revelation?The whole ""we're not all that different, you and I"" thing has been played out in the age-old ambiguous line between heroes and villains.While Pattinson's Bruce Wayne is hopped up on The Cure and Morrissey, grumbling around every scene, Dano's Riddler is a nice little mystery when in his mask. Less convincing out of it. But still, he is by far the most interesting character in the film.Zoe Kravitz is just not exuding the Feline Fatale like previous portrayers. Best things I can mention is that she is there, saying lines and moving around scenes.Colin Farrell doing De Niro doing Al Capone doing Al Pacino's Pruneface doing the Penguin did very little for me.The car was cool. Nice to see them go American Muscle this time around.And the ""big ending"" with the sea wall flood and the Riddler's followers seemed out of place, rushed and meaningless. The Riddler is supposed to be a lone enigmatic figure. The Joker has disciples. The Riddler inspiring a bunch of internet fanatics to get dressed up as him and wage his vengeful ramblings seemed tacked-on and out of place.Moreover, his ultimate plan is to flood the lower depths of the city, when the rich and powerful and corrupt that he is railing against all live in ivory towers. That made little sense and, again, seems like a set piece for the sake of climactic spectacle.The movie has atmosphere, for sure. A crushingly bleak atmosphere. There is little balance to it.

824,"The Batman, directed by Matt Reeves and starring Robert Pattinson and Zoe Kravits is a grittier, more modern, and some how lighter hearted take on the iconic character. The film takes place early in the dark knight's career with the story being set into him only two years into his battle with crime in Gotham. The story centers around the corruption that currently reigns supreme in Gotham and is revealed, death by death through the murders of influential parties by a serial killer known as the Riddler played by Paul Dano.The film's depiction of Gotham is much Darker, dirtier, violent and modern. Through out the film you see a rain drenched city completely littered in garbage and boarded up windows and days that are devoid of any bright sunlight. The few times you do see what could be considered a nicer environment the scene is filled with violence or the remanence there of. You might see batman investigating a murder in the upscale office or interrogating a criminal in a lavish night club. Regardless of the setting one thing remains consistent, there will most definitely be some sort of darkening aspect added to the area.That being said the Batman has its lighthearted moments. Keep in mind this film is set early on in Batman's career, so he makes mistakes, quite a few mistakes in fact. This lends to the subtle humor of the film that helps to dial down the intensity for a bit. After all as much as I enjoy watching Bruce Wayne brood between action sequences, a film that serious would become hard to watch, especially a three hour film.The mistakes made by a you vigilante are not the only aspects of the movie that lighten the mood. Batman's interactions with allies, acquaintances, and even enemies tend to be on the more casual side. Not every interaction is an important clandestine event. It takes more of a casual interview or interrogation approach to a majority of the interactions.This leads me to my next observation; this Batman movie puts a focus on Batman as a detective rather than gadgets and martial arts prowess. Throughout the film you can find Bruce quickly solving riddles while the surrounding entities struggle to understand their meaning. In essence this film is more of noir detective film than it is a superhero movie.",batman direct matt reev star robert pattinson zoe kravit grittier modern lighter heart take icon charact film take place earli dark knight career stori set two year battl crime gotham stori center around corrupt current reign suprem gotham reveal death death murder influenti parti serial killer known riddler play paul danoth film depict gotham much darker dirtier violent modern film see rain drench citi complet litter garbag board window day devoid bright sunlight time see could consid nicer environ scene fill violenc reman might see batman investig murder upscal offic interrog crimin lavish night club regardless set one thing remain consist definit sort darken aspect ad areathat said batman lightheart moment keep mind film set earli batman career make mistak quit mistak fact lend subtl humor film help dial intens bit much enjoy watch bruce wayn brood action sequenc film seriou would becom hard watch especi three hour filmth mistak made vigilant aspect movi lighten mood batman interact alli acquaint even enemi tend casual side everi interact import clandestin event take casual interview interrog approach major interactionsthi lead next observ batman movi put focu batman detect rather gadget martial art prowess throughout film find bruce quickli solv riddl surround entiti struggl understand mean essenc film noir detect film superhero movi,neutral

Boy, was I wrong.If you can get pass the fact that Robert Pattinson is playing Batman and focus on the story line and dialogs, then this adaptation of Batman is just like a cinematic version of an old comic book. This version is dark and focused on the detective work which is superb. The camera angles and some of the takes are just as if it was copied from a comics book pages. Amazing version and greatly written story. I am sure that most critics and fans would scream ""best Batman movie"" if the Batman was played by Christian Bale. The acting by the main characters and villains was just great.True Batman fans will appreciate this movie. (True in sense of having read comics books and not just having watched Nolan's trilogy).Also, don't complain about the movie being overall dark if your TV does not support 4k Dolby Vision.

841,"I'll begin this review by giving some context:
1. I am moderately interested in superhero films, but have never read a comic book
2. I have seen most Batman films (all Keaton, Kilmer, Clooney and Bale)
3. We decided to watch this as a couple for 'date night'. My wife is definitely not into superheroes.Overview:
The film really didn't feel very superhero-y and was more like a grungey, post-apocalyptic serial killer whodunnit (of sorts). Off the top of my head, sort of Se7en meets The Crow. Even though it's three hours, we did it in one sitting as it kept us gripped and wanting more.Pros:
The serial killer stuff is equal parts scary, gory and interestingThere are lots of actors who you'll recognise - as well as some very famous who you may not - who do actually get killed off (it makes you feel that nobody is really 'safe')There is a nice balance between expecting you to know stuff about the Batman universe in advance and notIt crams a lot in! (Batman, Catwoman, Penguin, Riddler, Joker, Capt. Gordon, Alfred etc.)It is a completely different take on the character and the context but I quite liked it. In this one you could at least understand why nobody would suspect this Bruce Wayne of being Batman.It was more 'realistic' than a lot of superhero films and felt like it existed in a version of New York in the not-too-distant futureCons:
At nearly three hours, it's long!The ending was a tad anti-climacticThe CGI was somewhat questionable in a number of partsThe 'flying squirrel' sequence was just strangeThere are a lot of POV shots (e.g. Riding a motorbike) which feel a bit like a video game and are jarringIt's a horrible one, but unfortunately Robert Pattison doesn't look like Batman. For a Batman who is so bareknuckle in his fighting style, you really needed a bulkier version of the character.Overall, it's worth a go, even if these kinds of thing typically aren't your bag. It'll be interesting to see where they'll go next as this film sets up so many potential avenues to explore in the future. Even though it's a chunky 3 hours, it moves along nicely and covers a lot of ground in that time in terms of world-building and character-establishing.

845,"I do like a good movie, and this is a bloody great movie. I wasn't entirely convinced of its brilliance on my first watch, but subsequent viewings have proven ""The Batman"" to be a near masterpiece of filmmaking precision. The only misstep, in my opinion, is the inclusion of Barry Keoghan's Joker. The exchange between Keoghan and Dano's Riddler toward the end of the feature was reminiscent of something from a Schumacher entry, or perhaps the 1966 Television show but with a slightly more sinister edge. Regardless, Matt Reeves tackles his movies with such deliberate cinematic focus that they impress even on occasions, such as this and ""Apes"", when the audience is familiar with, and has experienced numerous iterations/adaptions of, the material. Reeves doesn't rest on his laurels, he presents us with a Batman we haven't seen in a live action movie before; a detective whose character arc takes him from ""Vengeance"" to protector of Gotham City. The cast are all on excellent form, not a bum note to be found, with standout performances from Colin Farrell and Paul Dano as Penguin and Riddler, respectively. It's a successful piece of cinema because every job on this production has been performed by creatives at the top of their game. Greige Fraser's Photography, Michael Giacchono's Score, James Chinlund's Production Design and Peter Craig's Script are all excellent. I'd pick holes if I could.

847,"A fidelity to the Batman Series and comics and video games. The movie, in my opinion, truly respect the way that batman is represented in comics and video games . I found a movie who tell a detective story with some surprises, revelations and some investigations that are pretty pleasant to follow until the end . The Riddler is pretty terrifying and have some nice riddles ; but what i found pretty unrealistic its the way Batman found the answers ; too quick and feel weird . Other than that , i found the actor Robert Pattinson pretty convincing in the role of Batman and the Catwoman too . A good duo with some sensual scenes and action scenes too . The action scenes are pretty well made and i was happy that the action scenes were not the main focus of the movie and turn to a vulgar action movie. The story of the Bruce wayne's father was very good to watch and have some surprising moments , the story of catwoman who search her friend all along the movie make her pretty enjoyable to watch and we feel that she is pretty unpredictable and the batman relationship was interesting.

854,"The Batman, directed by Matt Reeves, is an extremely interesting and refreshing take on the comic book hero. The film showcases a darker world than previously seen in Batman films. The horror element does not hurt the film. It sets the mood of the setting. The cinematography is the real star of the movie. The visuals are great and accompanied by a great soundtrack as well. The action shots mixed with the music create an extremely fun and intriguing movie. By the end of the movie, the possibility of a sequel seems likely. This works well for all parties. If you enjoy the movie, you can be optimistic about future films. Robert Pattinson plays Batman and Bruce Wayne. He took the role over from Ben Affleck. The issues many fans had with Affleck's Batman, do not seem to be present with Robert Pattinson interpretation. If you are a fan of the Batman franchise, I doubt you will be disappointed. The movie will be available free on HBO Max, April 18. The one issue I had with this film, was simply the runtime. Standing at around three hours, the movie is certainly a long watch. There are many side plots that take a long time to conclude. This is not always a bad thing. However, I felt that some points of the movie felt like they were dragging on. Overall though, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.",batman direct matt reev extrem interest refresh take comic book hero film showcas darker world previous seen batman film horror element hurt film set mood set cinematographi real star movi visual great accompani great soundtrack well action shot mix music creat extrem fun intrigu movi end movi possibl sequel seem like work well parti enjoy movi optimist futur film robert pattinson play batman bruce wayn took role ben affleck issu mani fan affleck batman seem present robert pattinson interpret fan batman franchis doubt disappoint movi avail free hbo max april one issu film simpli runtim stand around three hour movi certainli long watch mani side plot take long time conclud alway bad thing howev felt point movi felt like drag overal though thoroughli enjoy movi,positive

It is a long movie but with good reason, each scene is deliberate in style and pace. I found myself in a happy place while watching this even though its such a dark film.

856,"Pattinson was great as Batman but terrible as Bruce Wayne. His Bruce Wayne felt like the Batman without his costume which isn't what it's supposed to be. Bruce Wayne, though a recluse, is quite a sociable guy, making it near impossible to conceive of him as the Batman. With Pattinson's Bruce Wayne, it would be quite possible for citizens of Gotham to reasonably conceive of him as the Batman.Kravitz's Selina Kyle is a 7/10. Great performance overall but her character's background makes it unbelievable that she has the fighting/movement skills especially juxtaposed to Hathaway's Kyle who was really just a seasoned thief.The chemistry between Batman and Catwoman here is really good but too emotional in the sense that Batman seemed to care too deeply for her for the shallow connection established here. It seems to me if all it took was a sob story to win Batman's affection, he's have fallen in love with tens of women in his time fighting bad guys in Gotham although Kravitz's size (small) makes it at least believable that Batman would be very protective of her knowing the league of bad guys she's messing with.This is a good mini origin story for the Penguin as this seems to show him ascending to the top after the death of Torturo's Falcone. Not a fan of too much prosthetics though.The mood is true to the dark nature of the Batman comics and has a very gritty feel. One good thing here is that it doesn't rely on too much technology, making it more grounded in reality than Nolan's. Though it could be argued that Nolan's is better because Bruce Wayne is essentially putting his billions to work in fighting crime through cutting edge technology in his devices.This feels like a better story compared to Nolan's dark knight but Nolan's edges this one in production and philosophy.Verdict: 8.5/10.

857,"I'm not going to lie - I have never been interested in Batman films, but when I saw the trailer for this rendition, my jaw dropped. It looked very action-packed, I loved the dark tone, and I was extremely intrigued to see what Robert Pattison would bring to the role.During the film, I ended up realising that I found Batman incredibly attractive. And I think that was mostly why I enjoyed the film. Don't get me wrong, it was great - there were plenty of nice shots and the story wasn't too fast-paced nor too slow, and it sets up nicely for a sequel; that being said, the budding romance between Catwoman and Batman felt rushed or stiff, and I just really don't find car chases exciting.I liked it a lot and will probably watch it again multiple times when it is released for digital streaming, and I think that is mostly due to the casting.

860,"I will be vague in certain parts of my review to avoid spoilers.I found scenes with the Riddler to be extremely cringy. I really could not stand watching his parts and I ended up scrolling through my phone when he was talking. When I mention the Riddler I mean the unmasked one. Masked Riddler was a good character and had convincing motivations driving his actions until the ending where I feel like they have just randomly written up a scenario so that we can distinguish between Batman and the Riddler. All the character development for the Riddler just went right out the window and it's suddenly just Riddler bad and Batman good. His character spent the entire movie exposing *spoilers* but the ending they wrote up was just a lazy-themed ""random guy does random bad stuff"" completely ignoring everything they showed the audience the past 2 and a half hours.The rest of the film was okay. Zoe Kravitz was decent as Catwoman. I also didn't mind Robert Pattinson as Batman. Though any chemistry between the both of them was nonexistent. The characters say Jesus every 10 seconds for everything they see which was quite annoying. But otherwise, it's a decent film.

863,"There's so much wrong with this movie. The first major problem is that it doesn't understand Batman. Batman Forever understood Batman better than this crap. Robert Pattinson plays Bruce Wayne as if he were an emo who spends his days locked in his dark room listening to Nirvana and My Chemical Romance. He doesn't even act like a human. He's like an edgelord teenager. I defended the casting choice leading up to the release of the film, but after seeing it I need to go back and delete every comment defending the casting of Pattinson.Second problem is Catwoman. Not the performance, but the character herself. She adds nothing to the film and the ""romance"" between her and Batman was so forced as there was never any chemistry between the two ""heroes."" The scenes with her are absolutely the most uninteresting and I think it would have benefitted greatly if she was removed so the movie was shorter and more focused on Batman being the detective and going against Penguin and Riddler. The pacing is already super slow but every scene with Catwoman feels like they stretched one page of screenplay into five minutes of film.Riddler is okay. I like Paul Dano. He doesn't get a lot to do. Penguin actually ended up being more interesting and he was given even less to do.Jim Gordon in this movie is terrible. Easily the worst character. All he does in this movie is read clues out loud and go ""What does this mean???"" And then Batman figures everything out. It's so boring.This is probably a 3/10 movie, but the fact that it's getting such good reviews infuriates me. I hate knowing that this is the future of Batman and Ben Affleck won't be getting his solo movie now after being replaced by an emo loser version of Bruce Wayne. I'm not saying Batman v Superman was great or anything but my God it was better than this by miles. At least it was made by people who are clearly fans of the characters. Everyone in this movie other than Colin Farrell and Paul Dano seem like they're miserable to be in the movie.This movie is boring and pretentious but has somehow convinced people it's a masterpiece. It's not. It's like the Batman version of Blade Runner 2049 but without the skill behind the camera that Denis Villeneuve brings to his movies.

865,"The Batman was directed by Matt Reeves, who co-wrote the screenplay with Peter Craig, Reeves also produced the film alongside others. This film is a reboot of the Batman film franchise and is set in a separate universe away from the DC Extended Universe, thus giving Matt Reeves full rein on his Batman universe. One of the choices he made was to explore Batman's detective side more than what previous films had done, drawing inspiration from 1970s films and comics such as ""Year One"", The Long Halloween and Ego. I would say Matt Reeves succeeded with it, making it stand out from other Batman films and most importantly, making it feel like a Batman film. His interpretation is grounded, accurate and overall fantastic for a fan of live action and comic book. The presence from its inspiration from Year One and The Long Halloween is felt and rightfully so, they're some of my favorite Batman graphic novels after all and Reeves' screenplay and Story is truly perfect and mesmerizing. So is his direction and visual storytelling, brilliantly done.During the second year of Bruce Wayne's career as Batman. The Riddler, a sadistic serial killer, begins murdering key political figures in Gotham, Batman is forced to investigate the city's hidden corruption and question his family's involvement.Robert Pattinson plays Bruce Wayne / Batman: a reclusive billionaire who obsessively protects Gotham City as a masked vigilante to cope with his traumatic past. Batman is around 30 years old and is not yet an experienced crime fighter, as director Matt Reeves wanted to explore the character before he becomes ""fully formed"", which in my opinion was the right choice to do. Zoë Kravitz plays Selina Kyle / Catwoman: a nightclub waitress, drug dealer, and cat burglar who meets Batman while searching for her missing roommate; her moral ambiguity challenges Batman's black-and-white view of good and evil. Paul Dano plays Edward Nashton / Riddler: a serial killer who targets elite Gotham citizens and livestreams his crimes. The Riddler seeks to ""unmask the truth"" about Gotham, taunting Batman and law enforcement with riddles. Jeffrey Wright plays James Gordon: an ally of Batman in the Gotham City Police Department. The only GCPD officer who Batman trusts. They're the leads, the supporting cast is too full of well known names like: Andy Serkis as Alfred Pennyworth, John Turturro as Carmine Falcone, Colin Farrell as Oswald ""Oz"" Cobblepot / Penguin and Peter Sarsgaard as Gil Colson.Greig Fraser worked as the cinematographer for this project and his beautiful cinematography is felt in every scene, together with the director, he made a cinematic masterpiece with it being one of the best shot superhero movies. But there's something with this character, this mythology and just Gotham in general that draws filmmakers and cinematographers to create stunning looking films, The Batman is among them. Michael Giacchino's musical score is well fantastic in a lot of ways, honestly one of the best musical scores I've ever heard, possibly. The film wouldn't be as good if it weren't for Giacchino's work, it's incredible. The editing is excellent. Production and art design are brilliant, I'll say the same to the sets and props. It feels like Gotham with its Gothic style, the Gargoyles and interiors, like the animated show and original Batman film or the Arkham games. The action sequences aren't over the top, they're too grounded and thus realistic. They're also shot extremely nice like the rest of the movie, an example of a well shot and epic action sequence are the dark corridor and another is the car chase. There's so many more and Matt Reeves truly nailed the action in this film, the fights seemed so human as this Batman is still so new to the violence as here he isn't truly the world's greatest detective or a beacon of hope, but something that the criminals fear, he's Vengeance.The Batman met my expectations and it's now regarded as one of the best superhero films I've seen, with its perfect cinematography and direction but also how gripping, gorgeous and how it's the grounded detective story the character deserves. Matt Reeves trusted his instincts with casting Robert Pattinson as Bruce Wayne and his interpretation is one of the best I've seen, I don't think another actor would have done such a good job with this version of the character, Robert was indeed the person Reeves wrote the character for. I also want to add how I loved Zoë Kravitz in the role as Selina Kyle, she brought the character straight from the comics and well it's brilliant. So Robert, Zoë and Paul Dano bring superb performances that you'll remember for a long time, but I didn't expect Jeffrey Wright would pull this impressive performance as James Gordon he truly made a special performance, a strong performance. Paul Dano likened the Riddler to the Zodiac Killer, whom he felt was the ""real-life"" Riddler for his practice of communicating with ciphers and riddles. It was the right choice, his performance is incredible and will be remembered fondly for years to come. Though Colin Farrell doesn't have a lot of screen time, he leaves a mark and a memorable performance as Oswald ""Oz"" Cobblepot / Penguin, I can't wait to see him in the upcoming spin off show and sequel as his performance was extremely memorable and entertaining to watch.I think this is a perfect movie but for a long review, I think I need to criticize something and I've read many critics criticizing the length of the movie and I don't agree with that as I feel it's needed for an epic noir driven tale about Batman's second year, I actually wanted the first and second act to be longer. I did feel the final thirty minutes or so could have been trimmed a little bit and maybe change some of the writing but I don't want to spoil anything in this review, the final act is still great though don't get me wrong, but there's a tiny flaw with it.Matt Reeves' rebooted Batman is a movie worth checking out, but also worth going back to as there's lots of references and easter eggs to be found. Matt Reeves respects the comics and the large mythology surrounding Batman and Gotham.

869,"Given the current landscape of superhero movies, (in several ways) ""The Batman"" is something different; and that definitely works in its favor. Namely, Robert Pattinson, whose performance walks the fine line between hurt and rage. He wears the pain of Bruce's childhood trauma on his sleeve, but brings such ferocity to his street justice. I have to give the man credit; this is a performance that sets his interpretation apart from previous Bat actors.But also (and this was my favorite aspect of the marketing campaign), Batman is an honest-to-god detective - something I've waited years to see on the big screen - and it fits this movie like a glove.This isn't my favorite Batman movie; the running time works against it, as well as the atmosphere that derives too much from ""The Crow"" and ""Seven"". And I appreciated it more from a technical standpoint which, since we're talking a superhero movie, surprised me a little. The camerawork, makeup and sound design are superb, and the Batmobile chase scene is nothing short of jaw-dropping. However, credit to Matt Reeves for giving this Dark Knight a character arc. I think it strengthens the third act immensely.I can't honestly gauge this film's replay value, but I enjoyed seeing it, and I'm up for a sequel.

872,"I just came back home after watching The Batman on IMAX. And let me say in advance: it's a 10/10 reboot. It seemed impossible, but Matt Reeves deserves a lot of kudos for delivering the very first true ""Batman"" as in the comics, instead of an exaggerated and over-the-top version for live-action.This is Batman, in his second year as the masked vigilante. So he still lacks experience, he's unsure of himself. A perfect sequel to the super classic Batman: Year One, by Miller and Mazzucchelli. If you didn't read that yet, I highly recommend you do it first.And finally, this is a truly grounded Batman. Different from Nolan's more ""Shakespearean"" approach. Reeves' Batman is more of a detective story with a psychological thriller structure that reminds us of Zodiac or Seven. And this is very refreshing. It's 3 hours long, but the story is engaging enough to keep us from feeling tired. If you don't like investigation stories, you won't like this Batman. This is not a popcorn blockbuster filled with bombastic action. This is way more interesting.It's very difficult to not discuss spoilers, so I will not do that in the first few paragraphs, but I want to discuss where the story goes from here. I will mark SPOILERS before writing about it down below.First of all, wow, I think this is the best cast of actors in any Batman. If you told me that Robert Pattinson would be a great Batman choice, in 2008, I would have laughed at your face, very hard. Anyone would. But in recent years he has proved that he's more than a teenager favorite. I changed my mind after Nolan's Tenet. And wow, he does deliver. He looks great in the mask, I can truly see Batman there. He is also a very good young Bruce Wayne. He didn't have enough to work on Bruce just yet, because it's Batman Year Two, so he's still not the super sharp, super clever Bruce in his 40s. This is Bruce in his 30s, so he's still edgy and unsure. Pattinson portrays this stage of Bruce very well. It's a super solid Batman, one that rivals Christian Bale's version.Second of all, wow again, Zoe Kravitz as Selina Kyle is by far the best version of Catwoman in live-action to date, bar none. Sorry, Anne Hathaway doesn't come close. Zoe's version is very true to Batman Year One, both visually and in attitude. Previous versions worried more about the visuals, but not about the character. In all previous movies, she wasn't important to the story, at all. In this incarnation, with a young and inexperienced Batman, she is a key point to the success of this story. We can't take away Catwoman and make this story work. So kudos for finally delivering a Catwoman that actually had a reason to exist in the story.Third, Jeffrey Wright is the first Jim Gordon that really feels like a true, working detective. Yes, Gary Oldman still is visually much closer to the comics' version. But Jeffrey Wright, as Zoe Kravitz, delivers a character that actually has more things to do than just look the part. And that's one problem I have with all Nolan's movies. They are laser-focused on Batman, and the secondary characters have very little to do in the stories. The Dark Knight is just Batman and the Joker. Dark Knight Rises is Batman and Bane and a twist ending that heavily destroys Bane as a character, the worst of the trilogy. Meanwhile, Gordon, Catwoman, and everybody else mostly just shows up, and they're gone, and you don't notice them.Michael Cane is still the best Alfred, and Michael Gough still is the one that feels more comics accurate. But Cane's Alfred speaks too much, feels more like a coach. And Gough's Alfred didn't have a lot to do. Now Andy Serkis' Alfred is more balanced. He didn't have a lot to do, but I think he was good enough to deliver a convincing Alfred for this version of Batman.Now the villains were a mixed bag. As everyone already knows Colin Ferrell steals the show. He's the best incarnation of the Penguin and he is very convincing as a mobster. Although he was not the main antagonist, I can see his character grow from here.Paul Dano was a fantastic Riddler. I never thought of the Riddler as a psychopathic serial killer, but now that I saw it, it seems very obvious that this was the only way to handle this character. Every other incarnation of the Riddler was handled very poorly and he always end up being goofy. Remember Jim Carrey? Now, this was a total 180 degrees shift and it's what makes this whole movie work. This is a very ominous presence.Different from Nolan's over-the-top and explosive Dark Knight, Reeves was super smart in toning down Batman to be more a street-level hero. He's still too strong, but Nolan's version was too buffed, he was too strong, too fast, with gadgets that could almost be in a Star Trek movie. Many people consider those movies ""grounded"" and ""more realistic"", but that was more about the darker tone of the movie. Batman itself was almost unbelievable.Now, the only miscast was John Turturro as Carmine Falcone. And it's a bummer because in this story Falcone plays a crucial role. But I can't see Turturro and not be reminded of goofy roles such as that wacky agent from Transformers. He doesn't have the gravitas to be the boss of the gangsters. I think they could've cast any of the mob leaders from The Many Saints of Newark, such as Jon Bernthal, Alessandro Nivola, or why not OG Ray Liotta himself?I'm focusing on the characters a lot because they are the sole reason this movie works at all. Again compared to the previous movies, Nolan likes to make big operas, big Shakespearean dramas, something to watch while listening to something like Beethoven's No. 9 or Chariots of Fire or something like that. Nolan's Batman and Joker are Shakespearean dramatic characters. Nothing wrong with that, but it takes away from the story and mostly from the other characters.In Reeve's incarnation, he is truly grounded. Gotham City is fully realized and finally works as a character. The story progresses with everybody playing a key role in it. The plot thickens and the big reveal does remind me of Finch's Seven. I'll come back to the finale in the spoiler section.In terms of visuals and production values, again this movie delivers. It's dark and gritty as we like it, but it's also believable enough. This version of Gotham sets itself clearly as New York City, and therefore Batman has more mobility using a bike than a car, which I think was a smart choice. Because Batman wouldn't be able to go anywhere in New York's traffic with the Batmobile. So the car is used sparingly in very specific situations and the rest is done by motorcycle.Batman relies less on gimmicky spear guns, and finally, it's not easy to just jump off buildings. At least not for Batman in Year Two. I like the way he's still inexperienced and functions less like a super ninja and more like a brawler.Undeniable 10/10.",came back home watch batman imax let say advanc reboot seem imposs matt reev deserv lot kudo deliv first true batman comic instead exagger overthetop version liveactionthi batman second year mask vigilant still lack experi he unsur perfect sequel super classic batman year one miller mazzucchelli didnt read yet highli recommend firstand final truli ground batman differ nolan shakespearean approach reev batman detect stori psycholog thriller structur remind u zodiac seven refresh hour long stori engag enough keep u feel tire dont like investig stori wont like batman popcorn blockbust fill bombast action way interestingit difficult discus spoiler first paragraph want discus stori goe mark spoiler write belowfirst wow think best cast actor batman told robert pattinson would great batman choic would laugh face hard anyon would recent year prove he teenag favorit chang mind nolan tenet wow deliv look great mask truli see batman also good young bruce wayn didnt enough work bruce yet batman year two he still super sharp super clever bruce bruce he still edgi unsur pattinson portray stage bruce well super solid batman one rival christian bale versionsecond wow zoe kravitz selina kyle far best version catwoman liveact date bar none sorri ann hathaway doesnt come close zoe version true batman year one visual attitud previou version worri visual charact previou movi wasnt import stori incarn young inexperienc batman key point success stori cant take away catwoman make stori work kudo final deliv catwoman actual reason exist storythird jeffrey wright first jim gordon realli feel like true work detect ye gari oldman still visual much closer comic version jeffrey wright zoe kravitz deliv charact actual thing look part that one problem nolan movi laserfocus batman secondari charact littl stori dark knight batman joker dark knight rise batman bane twist end heavili destroy bane charact worst trilog meanwhil gordon catwoman everybodi el mostli show theyr gone dont notic themmichael cane still best alfr michael gough still one feel comic accur cane alfr speak much feel like coach gough alfr didnt lot andi serki alfr balanc didnt lot think good enough deliv convinc alfr version batmannow villain mix bag everyon alreadi know colin ferrel steal show he best incarn penguin convinc mobster although main antagonist see charact grow herepaul dano fantast riddler never thought riddler psychopath serial killer saw seem obviou way handl charact everi incarn riddler handl poorli alway end goofi rememb jim carrey total degre shift make whole movi work omin presencediffer nolan overthetop explos dark knight reev super smart tone batman streetlevel hero he still strong nolan version buf strong fast gadget could almost star trek movi mani peopl consid movi ground realist darker tone movi batman almost unbelievablenow miscast john turturro carmin falcon bummer stori falcon play crucial role cant see turturro remind goofi role wacki agent transform doesnt gravita bos gangster think couldv cast mob leader mani saint newark jon bernthal alessandro nivola og ray liotta himselfim focus charact lot sole reason movi work compar previou movi nolan like make big opera big shakespearean drama someth watch listen someth like beethoven chariot fire someth like nolan batman joker shakespearean dramat charact noth wrong take away stori mostli charactersin reev incarn truli ground gotham citi fulli realiz final work charact stori progress everybodi play key role plot thicken big reveal remind finch seven ill come back final spoiler sectionin term visual product valu movi deliv dark gritti like also believ enough version gotham set clearli new york citi therefor batman mobil use bike car think smart choic batman wouldnt abl go anywher new york traffic batmobil car use sparingli specif situat rest done motorcyclebatman reli le gimmicki spear gun final easi jump build least batman year two like way he still inexperienc function le like super ninja like brawlerundeni,positive

874,"I went in with ultra-low expectations because I think Robert Pattison is a god-awful actor and, this film took my expectations and made me promptly realise that, you can always go lower.I'm actually angry I wasted 3 hours of my life (and trust me, every minute of that time was felt).However, let's have some positives: cinematography is great and the music is fantastic. The opening scenes with The Batman made me think, I was going to have another Heath moment and be forced to eat my words because those opening scenes are indeed something special.But then the film gets going. Part ""Saw"" rip-off and so desperately wants to be ""Se7en"" in its execution, the story dragged. You don't care about any of the characters and I found myself pining for Clooney and his bat-nipples and Mr. Freeze.What I found really funny though is the producer of this utter mess got in touch with Nolan and warned him, ""We're going to make a better Batman than you."" No. Just no.Like the last Lord of The Rings film, this has an ending that just keeps on coming. Something wraps up and you start to get ready to leave, the film continues. Something else is wrapped up and you think, ""That's it..."" and it keeps going.... Something else, and on and on and on...I can see why the guy in the seat nearby racked up a massive line of coke and snorted it midway through (and no, I'm not joking... Welcome to Southampton).With regards to the plank of wood.... Sorry... ""Pattison"". In the initial scenes I was genuinely excited. Never a fan of his costume before, seeing it here - suddenly I ""got it"". He proper beats down on someone in a vicious attack. They get back up... In fact, everyone he bat-punches gets back up and just attacks him from behind again. There's no real threat here. When Bale smacked someone down, they stayed dead. But then, when Bale stripped off (same as Affleck), they were built. Robert looked like me and I look like Mr. Burns from The Simpsons. A skeletal mess with no beef there whatsoever. In fact, when Robert bent over in one topless scene, his bones stuck out and I thought wings were going to pop out. But then, why wouldn't they when he infamously said he refused to bulk up for the role (I would have sacked him there and then).His time as Bruce is strictly limited - thank God - so you can't really judge him for that. As Bruce he just stands there and looks confused. As The Batman, by the end he became a parody. His Batman voice changed to the same sound as the joke Batman in the college humour videos (A is for Alfred = genius). When he was mad, it just look like he was pulling a cum-face. And don't even get me started on the Adrian Mole diary keeping that's going in with the voice-over narration.Honestly, with the exception of the opening ten minutes or so, I have never hated a film so much as I did this and given I went in with low expectations, even I am surprised at how fuming I am at myself for wasting my time on it.",went ultralow expect think robert pattison godaw actor film took expect made promptli realis alway go lowerim actual angri wast hour life trust everi minut time felthowev let posit cinematographi great music fantast open scene batman made think go anoth heath moment forc eat word open scene inde someth specialbut film get go part saw ripoff desper want seen execut stori drag dont care charact found pine clooney batnippl mr freezewhat found realli funni though produc utter mess got touch nolan warn go make better batman nolik last lord ring film end keep come someth wrap start get readi leav film continu someth el wrap think that keep go someth el oni see guy seat nearbi rack massiv line coke snort midway im joke welcom southamptonwith regard plank wood sorri pattison initi scene genuin excit never fan costum see suddenli got proper beat someon viciou attack get back fact everyon batpunch get back attack behind there real threat bale smack someon stay dead bale strip affleck built robert look like look like mr burn simpson skelet mess beef whatsoev fact robert bent one topless scene bone stuck thought wing go pop wouldnt infam said refus bulk role would sack thenhi time bruce strictli limit thank god cant realli judg bruce stand look confus batman end becam parodi batman voic chang sound joke batman colleg humour video alfr geniu mad look like pull cumfac dont even get start adrian mole diari keep that go voiceov narrationhonestli except open ten minut never hate film much given went low expect even surpris fume wast time,neutral

Robert Pattinson is a good choice for Batman, for he is so moody and mysterious. The use of music was also very good, low key and creepy. This is the kind of movie I can watch over and over again.

882,"Watched ""The Batman"" with Pattison just now. I can see why there is some polarity, if you check user reviews, but personally, I quite liked it.I agree that Pattison is ""controversial"" here, mostly because of the looks. Batman is one of those characters (along with Judge Dredd), that requires an actor with... Articulate chin and lips. And let's be honest it's difficult to call Robert's face ""masculine"". He does compensate for that with eyes, though.But aside from the looks, some people may find his overall portrayal of the character as ""too brooding"". And I would agree, that the haircut and overall demeanor of his as ""Bruce Wayne in public"" is a bit emo-style and does not fit the character that well. But again - that's (mostly) the looks.In terms of everything else, though... I would dare say that it is somewhat realistic. Or at least ""the feel"" of it all is. And I think that's where all controversy is coming from: it's not ""comics"". Previously even Nolan's trilogy of ""Batman V Superman"", which were relatively ""dark"", were ""comics"". This movie does not feel like ""comics"" based. I dare say, that if you removed all the knowledge about the character, you would not think of it as ""comics-based"" after watching.It has that kind of atmosphere... I am not sure how to describe it. It reminds me of some movies, probably mockumentary ones or even those older ""prohibited"" ones. Like something slimy, but without the slime. Like lump of dead flesh falling on the floor, because it is a real dead flesh and not some prop, because it's a snuff movie. It's ""yucky"". Close to ""Irreversible"" kind of yucky, but not on the same level, because otherwise it would scare the audience from the theaters.That's not something most viewers were expecting, I am sure. But it fits.What made Batman comics stand out back in the day (and to an extent today without people realizing it) were characters, that had psychological traumas or disorders. They usually were not driven by something ephemeral, there was order behind the madness. That's what made ""The Joker"" movie a hit, if you think about it.And ""The Batman"" delivers the same thing, but also on the ""hero"". There are glimpses of his insanity here and there. And only glimpses of the motivation. There is not much of ""bravado"" from Batman besides ""I am vengeance"" very early in the movie. The man is clearly in a state similar to mixed states of bipolar: he is depressive, he sees the world very darkly, but yet he has signs of mania, because he thinks that he is the only one (or one of the few) who can change that.And I think this scares a lot of viewers. Because it makes the character ""too human"". Even more human than the what Ben Afflek delivered in his ""disappointed by life"" version of Batman. It's no longer a ""rock"" akin to Superman and is even more ""human"" than Spider-Man, which became a hit because Peter was very relatable to kids and young people.Almost everything in the movie was delivering this kind of feeling. Or at least I interpreted it that way. Sense of lifelessness behind the act of life, I guess. Do I find the movie ""the best ever""? Hell, no. I agree, that it may be too long, for example. I would probably prefer it as a TV Series. Or maybe a series of shorter movies, like ""Spawn"" animation, which had similar atmosphere, actually. But, personally, I would not mind a continuation of this version. In fact, I'd prefer it more than continuation of Nolan's action-packed trilogy even.",watch batman pattison see polar check user review person quit like iti agre pattison controversi mostli look batman one charact along judg dredd requir actor articul chin lip let honest difficult call robert face masculin compens eye thoughbut asid look peopl may find overal portray charact brood would agre haircut overal demeanor bruce wayn public bit emostyl fit charact well that mostli looksin term everyth el though would dare say somewhat realist least feel think that controversi come comic previous even nolan trilog batman v superman rel dark comic movi feel like comic base dare say remov knowledg charact would think comicsbas watchingit kind atmospher sure describ remind movi probabl mockumentari one even older prohibit one like someth slimi without slime like lump dead flesh fall floor real dead flesh prop snuff movi yucki close irrevers kind yucki level otherwis would scare audienc theatersthat someth viewer expect sure fitswhat made batman comic stand back day extent today without peopl realiz charact psycholog trauma disord usual driven someth ephemer order behind mad that made joker movi hit think itand batman deliv thing also hero glimps insan glimps motiv much bravado batman besid vengeanc earli movi man clearli state similar mix state bipolar depress see world darkli yet sign mania think one one chang thatand think scare lot viewer make charact human even human ben afflek deliv disappoint life version batman longer rock akin superman even human spiderman becam hit peter relat kid young peoplealmost everyth movi deliv kind feel least interpret way sen lifeless behind act life guess find movi best ever hell agre may long exampl would probabl prefer tv seri mayb seri shorter movi like spawn anim similar atmospher actual person would mind continu version fact id prefer continu nolan actionpack trilog even,neutral
883,"Nice visuals, geat shots, and the best - most comic accurate - depiction of Gotham so far. The whole apmosphere of the city was awesome. I liked the casting, everyone was great in their roles, the chemistry worked between the characters. The idea behind the main story was also good, it could have been an interestig plot... But: it was sooo poorly executed! There were parts, where it felt terribly contrived, and despite it was a story which finally put Batman really in a detective role, he was terribly slow! And not just at the investigation but in the fight scenes, TOO! And in a Batman moovie those two things are quite unforgivable... You can find yourself yelling at the screen: 'MOVE! Do something, damn it!' They can say that he is still a newbie Batman, whitout enough experience, but good God, he felt so OLD and tired sometimes... And the long-long boring shots and meaningless slo-mos did not help.

At times it would seem almost unviewable but didn't feel like it was supposed to be!Andy serkis is another great actor but was totally wasted on playing Alfred.Jeffrey wright was an awesome Jim Gordon but he was a far cry from the make Gotham great Jim and more of a dependent on Batman to do his job for him JimThe fight scenes were pretty cool and well choreographed but for a 3 hour long film there wasn't enough and nowhere near as brutal as I went into the film believing them to be, also I understand that this film was set as year 2 Batman but why was he almost invincible? There were times when he should have been hurt, like probably not getting up from that one hurt and he just kinda shrugged it off without a scratchAnd finally, we were told we were getting a dark, unhinged and creepy Riddler, he started strong, when we finally see him without his mask he has a brief moment of looking the real deal and then in the blink of an eye he became nothing and ended up just being a disgruntled Redditor who recruited a small army of keyboard warriors to finish his plan, but why allow them to catch him so easily anyway?

885,"Let's start with what's not the best with this movie. It's very very long, it should of been shorter as there was a fair bit of stuff that made the movie bloated. Pattinson was a very mopey uncharismatic Bruce Wayne and Alfred did not feel like a father figure to Bruce. Oh and there was a very cringey line about wealthy white men but it's gone in a second.Positives, let's talk about them. Kravitz and Wright as Gordon and Selina Kyle where absolutely fantastic. Pattinson was great as Batman despite not being great as Bruce. Pattinson gives Batman levels. Farrell as Penguin was brilliant, you wouldn't even know it's him as was Turturros Falcone. Riddler was a very good villain too and had Batman questioning everything he believed in. Batman does more detective work in this film than in any other movie, he is clever and thorough.

This is well acted and well shot but even then at times the actors in this are so stiff and non emotional. For being grounded no one feels real. Pattinson is a young Batman and as Bruce Wayne in his goth phase, which is whatever but this movie just drags and drags across most acts. Writing at times is questionable and awkward. The Riddler is great here, for me he plays probably the best role out of anyone and I really do like the detective side of Batman, just not very much upon re-watch. It's long and should have been cut a little bit. I appreciate the style and story to be told here but not much else. I think this version of Batman and the universe has the potential for some really good stuff but unfortunately for me it's slightly above average.

893,"As one of the characters that has endured in American popular culture since the 1940s, Batman has seen a host of iterations and reimagining, each putting a new spin on the character and the world that he lives in. The Batman is perhaps the one that best puts all of these things together. It has the dark noir detective elements from the original comics (DC is Detective Comics, after all), the Gothic atmosphere of the Tim Burton movies, the political intrigue of the Nolan films, the urban griminess of Joker, and even the same lineup of villains as the Adam West version. As a result, it has the perfect ""Batman"" feel. This movie has something to offer for any comic fan. The movie's opening scene is perhaps the best opening scene of any superhero movie.Robert Pattinson was an interesting choice for the role of Batman. As strange as it sounds, he does play the role very well. He is a much better Batman than a Bruce Wayne, but that's alright considering how little screentime he has out of the suit. He is, however, a bit too moody out of the suit. I get that it's a younger Batman, but it's done to excess. Virtually every scene out of costume is like this. It is good that he still needs Alfred to be his common sense at that age perhaps. Alfred is played by Andy Serkis, who was fine, but give my Michael Caine over him any day. Paul Dano as the Riddler was fantastic. While he is quite different from the Riddler of the comics, the performance is so good it doesn't matter. Colin Farrell was unrecognizable as the Penguin. Zoe Kravitz plays Catwoman very well. She serves as a classic femme fatale, one of the foremost noir tropes. With the casting, there's also that certain other who shows up at the end. The casting decision... we'll see.The overall presentation of the film is excellent, and perhaps its biggest strength. As mentioned, the blending of elements from seemingly every Batman movie is excellent. It focuses on the detective element of Batman more than any of the other films, which it does very well. This is the best depiction of Gotham City in the movies. It not only feels like it could be a real city, but also feels truest to the comics. In the Burton films, it looks as though it takes place in Burton's mind, and in the Nolan films it looks like Chicago, where it was filmed. The Batman's version of Gotham finds the perfect balance between these two things. Grit and grime line streets of Gothic and Art Deco splendor. The filming locations were very well chosen, and the architecture of the city fits perfectly. It also matches the old time feel of noir and detective movies it's modeled on. None of this, however, prevents the movie from having its own unique elements. The cinematography was excellent, with some truly beautiful shots. There are some new elements like poverty causing crime (Joker did this too) and Bruce Wayne's wealth, which is kind of hit or miss in how it's executed. Michael Giacchino knocked it out of the park with the movie's score, as well as the effective use of classical music like Schubert's Ave Maria.Some people have made the bold claim that this is the best Batman movie ever made. While I don't think I would go that far, I understand the claim. There are things to nitpick. It may be an odd thing to complain about, but I wish the movie was rated R. It's clearly a much more mature movie that your usual comic-themed fare, but they don't go all the way like Joker does. There are some dumb moments near the end where it looks like Batman's going to die and he doesn't. At the end of the day, these things do little to affect the overall product.

Though I did not expect him to play such a depressed suicidal looking Bruce Wayne which he had a different vibe than the previous Bruce Wayne actors like Christian Bale and Ben Affleck. Ok Pattinson, your Twilight saga's been over for 10 years and no need to put your vampire acting into this Batman series. Just the whole movie was a bit too dark for an average Batman.

895,"What is the one thing that Bane or Darkseid or Deathstroke failed and Robert Pattinson succeeded in doing?'KILL THE BATMAN'Even with the storyline of the film and the super noir theme coming closest to the actual comic books, Pattinson fails to create the Cape Crusader aura big time.The story depicts year two of Batman's crime fighting in Gotham, with the dark knight portrayed more of a detective than a superhero, deep diving into his early years.. still the appearance, physique, voice, too much talking and ponderous dialogues, showing bollywood like emotions and a hell lot of public appearances (in bat costume) defies the whole identity of Batman.Apart from that the movie is a 3 hour marathon, things moving soooooo slow around Batman, (maybe the first superhero movie ever when I yawned), Riddler (who by the way was very good) was scarcely used, Penguin was more of a filler, Catwoman got so much screentime but they didn't venture into her character.. tbh the only character that stood out would be Carmine Falcone.. and that is just sad..There were some welcome action sequences, but again the Batmobil was a biggggggg disappointment.P.

897,"For 3 hours, I was on the edge of my seat absolutely enthralled by what I was watching on screen. The layers and interconnectivity to this story are incredible and make it a supremely rewarding viewing experience.Pattinson nails the role and brings some real emotion and vulnerability like we haven't seen before from this character. His arc in the film feels earned and genuine. The depiction of Gotham as this grimy, seedy world is the best we've seen yet on film and I felt completely transported. I loved the dark, nihilistic tone and The Riddler's serial killer-like persona was captivating. Just because there aren't forced jokes every 10 seconds like in an MCU film doesn't mean there isn't humor. There was plenty of humor, it was just dry and more subtle.Giacchino might have crafted the most perfect Batman score I've ever heard. I cannot get it out of my head. The scene where the Batmobile revs up was an unforgettable moment in the theater and the subsequent car chase was one of the most intense action scenes I've seen in years. The scene with Riddler talking to Batman about Bruce Wayne was jaw-dropping in its masterful design.

898,"This movie is probably the best depiction of a very young Batman so far.I was intrigued by the crime, the mystery, and the use of the underworld as a plot driver. The film was dark and gritty, and it held that mood throughout. I can see why some viewers might not love that, but I enjoyed kind of plunging into the dark and twisted parts of Gotham and if it has been light, bright, and happy, it would've been pretty disingenuous.Furthermore, the cinematography was perfect emphasising the role of each character especially our dark knight, also the soundtrack which helped the audience to merge into this dramatic world.The thing is many people seems to forget that in addition to fighting crime with his fists and high-tech gadgets, Batman is also an accomplished detective. His strategy of using stealth to sneak around for clues as well as his superior powers of deduction are rivalled only by the likes of Sherlock Holmes. Unfortunately, this quirk hasn't really been touched upon in past movies, instead focusing on the action-based aspects of the character, likely because most casual audiences would find these moments more fun to watch.

Obtaining information too late is even the less difficult sometimes, as it may involve creating a big highway accident.

914,"While you can say many things about this movie - it's too long, convoluted and has too much of everything, too many characters, etc - most of those things people already know and talk about.I wanna talk about the horrible score. I cannot believe how criminally bad music score is. You can say minimalism is kinda okay... but this is just shameful. Main theme is Funeral March only way worse and with only like three notes. Rest of the score is either very uninspired or sounds eerily familiar like something else or better.And then there's Nirvana's Something in the Way. It's a solid song and only song in the movie that is kinda working... and it's not the original score.I just hope that for the announced sequel, WB will hire someone capable of creating something actually good.Over the years we had some of best and memorable Batman themes and scores.

I appreciated how they had this movie focus on Batman's detective side, but most of the time, it felt like he wasn't getting anywhere, with half of the work and hints being given to him by the people around him. Maybe that was the point, to make him more human as opposed to super duper at everything, but it just felt off having him along for the ride going in circles.Like, when I first saw him standing and staring, I thought, oh he's thinking, he's about to come up with something, until halfway into the movie I realized, oh, he has no idea what's going on.Also, the entire time I felt like I was waiting for a big reveal that never happened. One of the big reveal, I thought was supposed to be apparent from the beginning.It was a young, inexperienced, angsty, and immature Batman, so it made sense for him to be bumbling around a bit, but maybe a bit too much here as he really didn't accomplish much until the end.Strong first half, but droned on for a total of 3 hours.",wasnt big fan ultim found movi bit bore appreci movi focu batman detect side time felt like wasnt get anywher half work hint given peopl around mayb point make human oppos super duper everyth felt along ride go circleslik first saw stand stare thought oh he think he come someth halfway movi realiz oh idea what go onalso entir time felt like wait big reveal never happen one big reveal thought suppos appar beginningit young inexperienc angsti immatur batman made sen bumbl around bit mayb bit much realli didnt accomplish much endstrong first half drone total hour,neutral

925,"First, two disclaimers:1. English is not my native language
2. I'm a fan of Batman only in the movies. I've seen them all, but I haven't read any comics.With that said, I begin.If we imagine a world in which Batman has never existed and neither have his movies, this could be considered a good, entertaining movie.But let's talk about the character: a battered Batman, with a Bruce Wayne straight out of a 2000s My Chemical Romance videoclip. What I was waiting for: emo Batman. In addition to a shallow and unconsistent character, I think the character itself was not achieved, badly. He does not captivate, he does not surprise. When you see Bruce Wayne you're in awe, he's stunned. Robert Pattinson achieves none of this.Let's talk about Selina Kyle's character: well accomplished and deep. Good performance from Zoë. However, the scenes of sexual tension failed to connect me. It felt uncomfortable and forced. What's this about Batman falling on top of her? What is this about kissing him unconscious?Another thing that disturbed me was that peogresist cliché scene criticizing ""white people's privilege."" Really Batman?Paul Dano, The Riddler: I never believed his madness. He was also a very poor character. I didn't get into it and, at all times, I felt that he wasn't able to separate himself from Heath Ledger's Joker. Bad.The music: very bad, very bad. He failed to connect me in a single moment. In the tense scenes they resorted to THE SAME resources as Nolan and Zimmer but without the same result. Also, you can't, (but you CAN'T) use the same chord progression for the Batman song as Darth Vader's imperial march. You just can't! It was ridiculous to listen to it.Photography and scenery well, very well achieved. However, I feel that Matt Reeves could not (or perhaps did not want to) detach himself from the Nolan legacy. If he tried, it was a resounding failure.

929,"Not a big Marvel/DC Universe fanboy---but the darkness and the allure of the original backstory of the Batman was one from my youth and continued through the Nolan Trilogy. As good as the Nolan films were, they were almost too ""big"" for the scale of the character; dark, vengeful, introverted. Where Nolans films may have missed, Reeves delivers...and boy does he.This is dark and brooding catnip for this long standing established Batman fan..though the timeline was skewed to allow a very important character seemingly ommited. It's easy to get past with Danos spectacularly portrayed Riddler. Dano nails it in the third act as he is unmasked and the creepiness and acting skills come out in full force, which, I almost wish his character was unmasked earlier---just to see his incredible acting skill come out from behind the shroud of obscurity.As for Pattinson, I had my doubts, and not because of his acting skill level, but moreso his physical presence. That was literally erased the first sequence of him fully suited and mowing through anyone that stood in his way.Watch this without distraction and dimly lit to help capture what Reeves delivers on.

934,"First, I am a mystery fan so I may be skeptical about this but with me, The Batman does not deserve the title ""mystery film"". The only time he ever show any kind of ""detective skill"" is when he did the ""DRIVE"" code. For the remaining screen time, he just walk slowly around the crime scene, giving anyone look at him a cold glare and eating up any bait that The Riddle throws at him. He did not ""catch"" The Riddler, The Riddle give himself to Batman. You do not call that a mystery story. Second, it not really a plot-hole but a world building-hole. The one I remember the most is when Catwoman is about to kill Falcon and Batman said ""You don't have to paid with him"". It can mean that she does not have to give up to her dark self but I think it has a more ""physical"" meaning like she will be wanted if she kills him and I really want to laugh out loud at this part. Because who will know she kills Falcon, and if someone know, who will chase her? One third of Gotham police is corrupted, and the remaining are still struggling to maintain Gotham's security itself. His men will not take revenge for him, people will do that for a cult leader, not a drug lord.

937,"It's clear to see why there are so many different reboots of the Batman character. Each director puts their own individual spin on the caped crusader and the vision that Matt Reeves presents to us in The Batman is magnificent.Tonally this film was spectacular. It was brooding, dark, violent, gothic, exactly what I wanted. I've seen some reviewers who didn't appreciate this tone which I can understand, it is all down to personal taste after all, but if you enjoy your superheroes throwing more punches than witty quips then this is the film for you.In terms of the performances I can't fault a single one. Robert Pattinson is a fantastic Batman. He fully became the character and looked so domineering in the suit. Zoe Kravitz was the perfect Catwoman. Her back and forth with Pattinson was a real highlight of the film. Colin Farrell as The Penguin was perhaps my favourite performance however. He was insanely good in this film, a truly transformative role and a brilliant interpretation of the character. Jeffrey Wright as well was superb. The entire cast were stellar. No exceptions.Another important aspect of a Batman film is Gotham City itself, and I loved how they brought it together. It had a gothic feel which complimented the plot and themes perfectly. The constant rain and predominantly night time setting made it visually enticing.As for the story, I loved it. We get to see Batman doing some great detective work, working closely with Jim Gordon and piecing together The Riddler's scheme. There are so many references and world building that Batman fans will love, signalling promising things for any sequels and spin offs that get the green light. The action was so well done. The Batman that we see is very rough, violent, still finding his feet, and it makes for some terrific punch ups.For a three hour film it flew by.

Matt Reeves delivers a distinctly darker, more intense, frighteningly realistic noir thriller than past adaptations, with an aggressively vengeful Bruce Wayne / Batman and a fear-inducing, mysterious, lunatic Riddler.Greig Fraser's cinematography - bone-chilling ""ins-and-outs"" of Batman and stunning footage of Gotham - and Michael Giacchino's score - genuinely addictive, elevates the entire film - make this adaptation the best-looking and best-scored cinematic version of the Batman ever.Even with the narrative focus on the detective work, the action sequences are exhilarating and beautifully shot. The entire cast is extraordinary, especially Paul Dano and Robert Pattinson - the latter destroys all skepticism around his talent.Apart from a short period at the end of the second act, the three hours fly by.

940,"After many years The Batman has finally made its way to the Cinema and I managed to get to the cinema and watch it and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a Batman in the early part of his career having to take on a new foe which will push him to new levels and makes him question his whole motivations.Main Character
There was plenty of controversy when Robert Pattinson was cast as Bruce Wayne/Batman but I actually had high hopes and I have to say I thought he did a really good job. He sold the pretty new Batman well, he is probably the most aggressive version of the character and you just feel the intensity radiating off of him. But there is real development here and I feel like the version we meet at the beginning of the film compared to the one at the end has changed quite a bit and it is well handled. This is very much a Batman film and thus sees him less as Bruce Wayne but when he is, it works well enough it just isn't the focus of the film.Supporting Characters
Zoe Kravitz plays Selina Kyle/Catwoman and she is great. The dynamic between the two of them is really well handled and I really enjoyed watching her character develop as there are some really interesting story parts with her. Paul Dano plays The Riddler and they do an amazing job with this character. He is like a horror character and seeing him go about his mission is fascinating and he was the perfect villain for this film, his motivations were really well executed and this is redemption for this great character. Jeffery Wright plays James Gordon and this is another stellar depiction of the character, he is tough but fair and I really liked the partnership between him and Batman. Despite their relationship being quite new there is clear trust and respect between the two of them. Colin Farrell plays The Penguin and despite being caked in prosthetics it is a really strong character, it feels honest to the comics and creates this really cool mob character that fits well in this universe.Story
The story is expertly handled, this is a true detective story. For the first time really in film, it feels like Batman is a proper detective and this mystery kept me guessing and the twists and turns were really effective. There are so many characters and plot points here that I was worried it was going to be too much, but it all fits together really well and nothing felt out of place to me and that was a really impressive piece of storytelling to me.Script
The script is extremely grim and this is no doubt the darkest Batman film we have ever seen. But it really fit this film and I was fine with it, this film writes all of its characters really well and keeps the film progressing in a really interesting and for me captivating way.Style
The film has an amazing style, Gotham has never looked better, it is so bleak and grey that it feels like it is ripped straight from the comic books. The harder hitting action is so well done and makes Batman way more brutal and less reliant on gadgets which feels extremely fitting for the story that was being told here. Yes, the film is 3 hours but I thought the film was paced really well and I was never bored. There wasn't anything that I thought should have been cut or trimmed down and fair play to Matt Reeves as a director who did an amazing job here.Overall
Overall, The Batman is a truly special comic book film that I loved.

941,"A great cinematic experience, although with some flaws mostly in narrative and structural sense.This really feels like a true Batman movie , and Pattinson is a right fit for it.Every single person involved in making this did exceptional job and poured their hearts in it, but major props should go to the score/cinematography/makeup team.Like everyone has said before, it is so refreshing to have a 'superhero' genre crafted on this level and looking like real cinema.Functions really well when it is a procedural thriller, but isn't that interesting when it focuses on its mob subplots...
Overall story isnt anything we haven't seen before and doesn't push the genre in any new way, it's just fine for what it is. It also becomes too convoluted towards the end.3 hour runtime is not entirely earned , but it isn't felt that much due to immersive world.Pacing loses some steam in the long second act before it picks up again towards the end. And even with this runtime some characters and relations remain underdeveloped (Alfred especially)
There aren't many memorable setpieces or scenes.(besides maybe the batmobile chase)All in all, a very, very good foundation for everything to come in this universe, from spin-offs to full trilogy.P.s. Colin Farrell really nailed it by totally disappearing in his character with both his acting and mask.",great cinemat experi although flaw mostli narr structur sensethi realli feel like true batman movi pattinson right fit iteveri singl person involv make except job pour heart major prop go scorecinematographymakeup teamlik everyon said refresh superhero genr craft level look like real cinemafunct realli well procedur thriller isnt interest focus mob subplot overal stori isnt anyth havent seen doesnt push genr new way fine also becom convolut toward end hour runtim entir earn isnt felt much due immers worldpac lose steam long second act pick toward end even runtim charact relat remain underdevelop alfr especi arent mani memor setpiec scenesbesid mayb batmobil chaseal good foundat everyth come univers spinoff full trilogyp colin farrel realli nail total disappear charact act mask,positive
942,"Bruce Wayne (Robert Pattinson) is The Batman. His parents' murders remain unsolved. Gotham is drowning in crime and corruption. Batman works in the shadows and has become the feared vigilante of every criminal. The Riddler (Paul Dano) is on a crusade against this corrupt city and leaves riddles at crime scenes for The Batman. Lt. James Gordon (Jeffrey Wright) brings him in to help. Selina Kyle (Zoë Kravitz) as Catwoman is looking for her missing friend and joins forces with The Batman.This is a brooding Batman. Sure, he's always brooding but this is the most broody-est. At times, Pattinson is mute. He is Twilight plus. I love the opening shadow motif. I ended up looking hard at every darken corner. It's telling that the big song is Nirvana's ""Something in the Way"". Bruce Wayne is a depressed 90's emo kid. I like it. I like Kravitz even more. In fact, she's the reason for the movie's one big flaw. It's too long. Three hours is a long time to spend with a depressed angry Batman. Catwoman's emotional arc is much more compelling and ends at the two hour mark. The movie should wrap up at that point. She is such a compelling character and her story is so much more emotional. The story should wrap around her journey. Riddler's reveal can be left to the next movie. He's a more compelling villain when left unseen. His riddles are the true stars of his character.

944,"The Batman is truly the movie the hero deserved, which is controversial since I didn't get this as a hero movie, and not that it's a bad thing, it was perfect! Matt Reeves works so well in this film that he even jokes about it. His mastery of narrative and history is something that feels personal and long-standing. The dark, serious, police and dramatic atmosphere of the film does not make it a movie to watch once, as happened with Joker in 2019. Although the film presents itself as such, the experience here is so satisfying, that the almost 3 hours of movie go unnoticed and you end the movie wanting to rewatch it right then and there.But let's talk about the duo, Tonico and Tinoco from Gotham: Commissioner Gordon and Batman form a police and detective duo with an absurdly well-crafted and coherent chemistry. The two build the narrative together, taking steps together as the mystery is being solved and at the same time escalating into something greater. Although Gordon doesn't even know who the madman behind the noir mask is, their mutual trust is eye-opening! Across the street, Selina Kyle is also the perfect match for the Batman, a mix of competition, romance and camaraderie that works in a unique way. She likes to see.Paul Dano takes the Riddler's portrayal of the villain to another level, delivering viewers a crazy and intelligent maniac at the same time. The fact that the antagonist is above the protagonist, and the protagonist struggles to reach the final solution and reach him in his attacks, transforms the film into a masterpiece of films for the genre. With a large cast of characters, Matt Reeves manages to dominate the satellite cast and deliver depth to ALL of them.In The Batman I was able to witness one of the best sequences involving car chase in all of cinema. An orchestra in the form of a scene. DC fans have a reason to smile this early March.Matt Reeves is the father of cinema, Robert Pattinson is the ultimate Batman, born to play Gotham's bat.

I really like those type of movies but would you want to see Batman in any of them?I guess they would still be decent movies but the superhero presence would kind of ruin them in some ways.The Batman has too much plot complexity, depth and drama which puts the viewer in a certain frame of mind like those other movies I mentioned, but then you see the superhero and the brain has to switch to a different frame of mind. At least for me that doesn't work.The Joker for example worked as a drama because there were no superheroes.The Batman is still a good movie but it would have been better with more good action, which kind of lacked, less drama and half hour shorter.",watch batman felt like watch seriou suspens thriller drama movi like untouch prison silenc lamb seven side effect realli like type movi would want see batman themi guess would still decent movi superhero presenc would kind ruin waysth batman much plot complex depth drama put viewer certain frame mind like movi mention see superhero brain switch differ frame mind least doesnt workth joker exampl work drama superheroesth batman still good movi would better good action kind lack le drama half hour shorter,positive

In my opinion, this one isn't quite on the level of Batman Begins or The Dark Knight, but I'd say it's better than The Dark Knight Rises. It's very dark and much more somber than any other Batman movie (maybe one scene that's sort of bright). My only real complaint is that sometimes the CG was pretty obvious.

949,"The Batman perfectly captures who Bruce Wayne and Batman really are. Bruce Wayne is an angry and depressed and traumatized young man. He is struggling to figure out who he is because he's torn between his billionaire playboy persona and his alter-ego Batman. Basically, he's struggling with an identity crisis. Bruce Wayne still holds all the anger regarding the deaths of his parents. Batman is a terrifying, almost unstoppable menace that rages war on crime in Gotham City. He calls himself ""Vengeance"" because that's what he is all about: avenging his parents by beating up criminals in order to deliver justice. Robert Pattinson played both roles perfectly. No jokes. No humor. Just depression and darkness. Matt Reeves' direction was amazing! The writing by Reeves and Peter Craig was top notch! Michael Giacchino's score was fantastic! The performances of the cast (Zoë Kravitz, Paul Dano, Jeffrey Wright, Colin Farrell, John Turturro, and Andy Serkis) were incredibly outstanding!

This day in age, it's all we see, so it makes me appreciate this movie even more.Finally, what i loved the most about this movie (as silly as it may sounds) was the fact that they didn't portray cat woman to be indestructible or stronger than men. She was a woman, she could move fast and probably defend herself way better than most women, but at the end of the day , she is weaker than men and this film had no problem showing that.",agre review mention movi everyon never fan overwhelm amount action watch good ol crime film superb act quit refresh pretti cool focus crime solv batman known comicsth littl action film visual plea doesnt let audienc lose focu plot cant tell much hate hour long fight scene marvel movi thing go day age see make appreci movi even morefin love movi silli may sound fact didnt portray cat woman indestruct stronger men woman could move fast probabl defend way better woman end day weaker men film problem show,positive

The ONE thing that really truly turned me off about this movie was the politicized nature , the woke culture I unfortunately doomed it. Of course jabs at ""white privileged "" had to be said actually said in the movie!!! Ridiculous!! Cat woman was a mixed girl or Latina , Gordon was a black man, they even got an Asian in there being beat up by a bunch of white guys - gee how ironic. I couldn't understand a damn thing Alfred said lol. The white mayor was corrupt and the new black WOMAN mayor who ran against him was the so called savior.Again - predictable moments where Batman could've should've died with a shotgun to his face for about 5 seconds and low and behold here comes someone to thwart the take down.

958,"NO SPOILERS!I just loved every aspect of this movie. Other than one woke line, I wouldn't want anything to be changed about this movie. It's not like other superhero movies. The hero doesn't necessarily win. The stakes are high. The villain is sympathetic. The hero is the main focus of the story. Not once did this movie try to do something that wasn't relevant to the plot. We see the side characters through the POV of the hero which is why they weren't explored properly (their series are in work for further exploration though). This movie was closer to Mask of Phantasm and Long Halloween than it was to The Dark Knight. I know comparisons are inevitable but this movie is a whole different ball game.If you are expecting lots of action, this movie isn't for you.If you don't have a stomach for violence, this movie isn't for you.If you can't sit through a plot-heavy movie, this movie isn't for you.If you want to have a light-hearted time with family and friends, this movie isn't for you.Manage your expectations and this movie will deliver. It does what it set out to do which is telling a very noir-detective thriller that focuses on Batman. It is not your typical superhero movie, it is going to expand the horizon of how superhero movies are made. A completely ground-breaking comic book movie. I won't compare it to any other comic book movie because there is no other comic movie that is like this movie. It can work both ways but it mostly works in favor than in against this movie. There is no weaker 3rd act as many reviewers have pointed out. If you follow the plot, it was completely necessary to give Batman his much-needed character development.

960,"I have never had more excitement for a film in my life. I was lucky enough to be able to see it at the premiere tonight, along with a second viewing for tomorrow afternoon courtesy of AMC Investor Connect, and another viewing Thursday at 12 am courtesy of AMC Crew AND tickets for opening night. I received/bought all of these prior to the review embargo lift date even being announced, that's how hyped I was for this movie. With that being said, this has quickly become my favorite film of all time. Now that's just a personal opinion, but critically I do believe this is the best comic book movie, ever. I'm not going to sit here and compare this to the Dark Knight, they are very similar in approach but vastly different in execution. Christopher Nolan created a realistic Batman in a realistic world. Matt Reeves created a realistic world with a grounded Batman to occupy it, keyword; Grounded. I view the difference between Grounded and Realistic in a simple way. Batman is a comic character end of the day, things cannot always be realistic with him, that's where Christan Bale's Batman fails in my book, they were trying too hard. Robert Pattinson's take on The Batman has the aspects of the comic book movie characters but grounded, the world around The Batman is highly realistic and true to life, but the Batman himself is not entirely realistic, he's grounded.I HIGHLY recommend seeing this film in IMAX, the most immersive you will EVER be with Gotham.Edit: I forgot to mention the brilliant performances in this movie.

965,"I was genuinely looking forward to this, unlike many people, I was interested to see what Robert Pattinson did with the role, and where this story would take us.I left the Cinema with very mixed feelings.The overall tone, mood, cinematography and score of this film are excellent, there is much inspiration pulled from previous films such as Se7en, Zodiac, Blade Runner, Taxi Driver etc. Some of the cinematography is also reminiscent of films from the 1970's, very gritty and grainy with soft focus, take the subway station scene near the beginning of the film for instance). The Gotham presented here is a real dystopia, much more so than in previous film outings. It pushes up to the borderline of ""too far"" but never quite crosses it, you can just about understand why people still live there when they don't have much other choice, but only just.Pattinson was a very good Batman (although not so good as Bruce Wayne) quite reserved and not too flashy with the gadgets, this made for a good change of character compared to what we are used to, I also liked the way he works the actual crime scenes with the Police, this gave a very refreshing and different perspective. You also get a very good sense of the fact that the criminals really fear the Batman. The general public are preyed on by the criminals, but the criminals are also afraid to step into the shadows and back alleys of Gotham because they are preyed on by the Batman, which is a nice touch.The Riddler is also a rather good villain in the vain of the Zodiac as previously mentioned, even though his ""master plan"" really loses steam and becomes a little muddled towards the end.There are some issues with this film, and I will touch on them here.For starters, and the main issue for me, it is just far too long. In all honesty, a full hour could be cut from this film and it would actually be better for it.Catwoman could be completely removed and the film would not suffer at all, in fact, again, it would be better without the character and her plot-line. Also the useless ""romance"" plot which has no chemistry and really goes nowhere, only really exists to extend the running time.Lt. Gordon (aka Basil Exposition) is useless, how he ever ascended to his eventual role in Gotham is quite beyond me. He basically serves to provide an oratory narrative for the audience about what is going on. Every time they find a clue he just stands there and says ""what does that mean?"" and Batman gives him the answer.The plot also moves around too much and tries to cover too many characters and too many different arcs (this may be the cause of the running time).To sum up:
Whilst it has succeeded in some areas, it has failed miserably in others, and this spoiled my enjoyment of what could have been an extremely well crafted two hour (two and a half at the very maximum) film rather than three hours with much unnecessary fat.Unfortunately most films are heading this way nowadays: Bond, Fast and Furious etc they are all 2hrs 45mins plus, and they just are not the types of film to warrant such a running time, Batman is in the same group.With The Batman, if they cut a couple of characters, strengthened a couple of other characters, reduced the running time and tightened the script up, it would have been a real winner.

966,"STAR RATING: ***** Brilliant **** Very Good *** Okay ** Poor * AwfulGotham City is rocked by a series of murders of key political figures, by a sadistic killer calling himself The Riddler (Paul Dano), who holds the city to ransom, revealing darkly guarded secrets and threatening more mayhem until he is stopped. 'The Batman' (Robert Pattinson), the alter ego of millionaire Bruce Wayne, starts an investigation of his own, crossing paths with a woman called Selina Kyle (Zoe Kravitz), who operates as 'Catwoman' and wants to find out what happened to her friend. It sets them both on a collision course with the darkest elements of Gotham's underworld, including notorious gangster 'The Penguin' (an unrecognisable Colin Farrell) and crime boss Carmine Falcone (John Turturro), who may be sitting on a devastating secret that could shatter both their lives.The Batman series must be one of the most enduringly successful franchises in the world of comic book films, appearing in various different incarnations since its original creation. Here, writer/director Matt Reeves delivers a mammoth three hour long interpretation of his own of the character that many seem to be hailing as the best ever. Less doesn't seem to be more anymore, at least not to the cinema artistes, but from this end, all I can see is a film drowning in its own indulgence.Reeves is obviously keen to maintain the bleak, heavy tone established by Christopher Nolan, and so we have a Gotham City with seemingly endless heavy rain, and gloomy skies, set against Pattinson's dark, brooding stare and gravelly voiceovers, set to the background of the emo rock soundtrack. It's just one of many things ripe for parody in a film that takes itself much too seriously and feels almost devoid of any humour and light. Even more overdone is Dano's dark 'Riddler', operating in some garish gimp suit that just looks ridiculous. Thrown in to this is the topical 'social justice' speeches that litter film and TV today, with Kravitz's Catwoman even praising the 'sinister' villain (who we're meant to hate!) at one point, for killing 'all these white privileged a$$holes.' It's just trying to cram a whole load of eggs in to one basket, over ambitious and overlong, and by the time of the main villain's grand 'master plan' at the end, you're too overwhelmed (or bored) to care.Everyone else can think what they like, but personally this is one of the most pretentious Batman's ever, which might have been a bit more bearable if it had just been less self indulgent, or at least had an old fashioned, Lawrence of Arabia style 'intermission' at some point. **",star rate brilliant good okay poor awfulgotham citi rock seri murder key polit figur sadist killer call riddler paul dano hold citi ransom reveal darkli guard secret threaten mayhem stop batman robert pattinson alter ego millionair bruce wayn start investig cross path woman call selina kyle zoe kravitz oper catwoman want find happen friend set collis cours darkest element gotham underworld includ notori gangster penguin unrecognis colin farrel crime bos carmin falcon john turturro may sit devast secret could shatter livesth batman seri must one enduringli success franchis world comic book film appear variou differ incarn sinc origin creation writerdirector matt reev deliv mammoth three hour long interpret charact mani seem hail best ever le doesnt seem anymor least cinema artist end see film drown indulgencereev obvious keen maintain bleak heavi tone establish christoph nolan gotham citi seemingli endless heavi rain gloomi sky set pattinson dark brood stare gravelli voiceov set background emo rock soundtrack one mani thing ripe parodi film take much serious feel almost devoid humour light even overdon dano dark riddler oper garish gimp suit look ridicul thrown topic social justic speech litter film tv today kravitz catwoman even prais sinist villain meant hate one point kill white privileg ahol tri cram whole load egg one basket ambiti overlong time main villain grand master plan end your overwhelm bore careeveryon el think like person one pretenti batman ever might bit bearabl le self indulg least old fashion lawrenc arabia style intermiss point,neutral

The riddler was a good villian, though I feel we did not get to see enough of him, and a little more screen time for him would have added a bit to the film.

It works really well with the story, and also matches his more violent nature, thanks to the performance of Robert Pattison, who does a great job as Batman.The Story was also solid too. The main problem is that it was too long, and could've had about 15-20 minutes cut to make it tighter. But even with that, the story is still engaging, and is an is an intriguing and fun mystery to follow. Also, the cinematography and action were stunning, thanks to Greig Fraser.The characters were also solid. I liked the arch Bruce Wayne/Batman went on, discovering his parent's past, and learning to acknowledge the past, but also focus on the future. Zoe Kravitz also does a good job, but when the third act hinges on Batman and Selina Kyle's romance, it didn't work for me, because they didn't have the best chemistry.

995,"Well, just finished watching this for the first time and the overall feeling it left in me is slightly on the positive side.For fans of Batman and especially the Nolan depiction there's not all that much to be considered ""groundbreaking"", but it does a fair job of matching the tone with the protagonist, that being dark.Pattinson's version of the winged vigilante works on some levels and fails on others. I personally appreciated Batsy being a bit more on the detective side in this one and Paul Dano's Riddler is a choice adversary to bring out just that.The odd action setpieces here and there are passable, although Batsy's bullet-spongy armor leaves me questioning just how concerned should i be of his well-being at any point. I might've appreciated a bit more creative approach when he's dealing with armed thugs, y'know, as if he actually might not want to get shot at.The mystery Batman heads to solve is an interesting spiral of shifting targets and infernal machinations with Riddler pulling the strings beyond it all. The ultimate antagonist's Jigsaw-level ingenuity and puppeteering is spot on and well thought thru, for the most part.""For the most part"", indeed. It's a disclaimer you can add to practically all facets of this movie. What minor negatives i found with the movie is magnified tenfold due to the movie's length.The story, the characters, the tone, all of it works, but this here is a prime example of a movie outstaying its welcome.The dark and gritty tone is fine and enjoyable, but when it goes on for 3 hours, it starts to wear on you. Especially as there are obvious pacing issues in multiple fields, not least of which is the visual storytelling.I understand you might want to portray Gotham as dark, rainy and gloomy, but if you obstinately refuse to contrast that at any point at all, you start to get tired of the look of the film by the time you've watched the first hour of it. Hence i'm somewhat puzzled with some of the opinions where people actually applaud the flick for its cinematography. I mean, visually i could've got the same enjoyment watching a rusty paintbucket in a dimlit shack for three hours.Whatever problems there are with the cinematography, the same goes for the story too. Plenty of twists and turns give an impression that Batsy's now dealing with a whole new level of diabolical. But... When it goes on for 3 hours, with many questions just about to be answered only to be flipped upside down all of a sudden, that too starts to wear on you. Batman/Wayne goes from one locale to the next only to be first led astray or lied to, then squeezing some form of narrative revelation, which then turns out to have been a ruse also. At some point the viewer has been led to so many sidesteps it's hard to feel the story really progressing all that much or meaningfully.So yeah, i could probably pick apart many other aspects of the movie, but at this point i think the problem's clear. Lot of good ingredients, decent writing, acting and whatnot. Just cut it a healthy amount shorter. This story has no business being over 2 hours long and all aspects of the movie are hampered by this.If you're a fan of Batman (as i am), i recommend watching it, once. I doubt i'll ever revisit it, unless they release a considerably tightened cut at some point.",well finish watch first time overal feel left slightli posit sidefor fan batman especi nolan depict there much consid groundbreak fair job match tone protagonist darkpattinson version wing vigilant work level fail other person appreci batsi bit detect side one paul dano riddler choic adversari bring thatth odd action setpiec passabl although batsi bulletspongi armor leav question concern wellb point mightv appreci bit creativ approach he deal arm thug yknow actual might want get shot atth mysteri batman head solv interest spiral shift target infern machin riddler pull string beyond ultim antagonist jigsawlevel ingenu puppet spot well thought thru partfor part inde disclaim add practic facet movi minor neg found movi magnifi tenfold due movi lengthth stori charact tone work prime exampl movi outstay welcometh dark gritti tone fine enjoy goe hour start wear especi obviou pace issu multipl field least visual storytellingi understand might want portray gotham dark raini gloomi obstin refus contrast point start get tire look film time youv watch first hour henc im somewhat puzzl opinion peopl actual applaud flick cinematographi mean visual couldv got enjoy watch rusti paintbucket dimlit shack three hourswhatev problem cinematographi goe stori plenti twist turn give impress batsi deal whole new level diabol goe hour mani question answer flip upsid sudden start wear batmanwayn goe one local next first led astray lie squeez form narr revel turn ruse also point viewer led mani sidestep hard feel stori realli progress much meaningfullyso yeah could probabl pick apart mani aspect movi point think problem clear lot good ingredi decent write act whatnot cut healthi amount shorter stori busi hour long aspect movi hamper thisif your fan batman recommend watch doubt ill ever revisit unless releas consider tighten cut point,neutral
996,"After seeing the trailer, I thought this film looked amazing but it turns out it is one of those movies that shows all the best parts in the trailer.It is hard to give this movie a 1 star rating because it is very well made but this is easily the most boring Batman film ever made. I enjoyed this movie even less than the Clooney version.The film has a good look for the most part and is like some of the comics but it is style over substance. The action scenes are very well done but they are very short and few between. If you saw the trailer, you have basically seen them and there will be no surprises.There are no characters in the movie you care about and Catwoman is annoying and physically unattractive yet they had to force a romance despite the actors having no chemistry.The Riddler is a serial killer that is murdering corrupt politicians. Do you really care that Batman stops him from killing these evil guys?One major thing this films lacks, especially considering it is a Batman movie, is a good villain. The Riddler is the main bad guy but he really isn't in the movie that much and never appears on screen with Batman. Even when he is caught, Batman watches outside a window as the police arrest him (this is somewhat shown in trailers). Batman later visits him in Arkham but they are once again separated by glass (also shown in the trailers).As for the acting, everyone just whispers in the movie, except for the Riddler who will randomly raise his voice in an attempt to act crazy.Thankfully, Robert Pattinson is no shown as Bruce Wayne much in the movie because he looks like Frankenstein's monster the times he is shown. You'd think it is a good thing to have so much Batman in a movie, but he mostly just stands around and whispers boring conversations.The worst thing about this movie is how boring it is. Batman is one of the most fun characters ever created but they sure managed to make him dull.",see trailer thought film look amaz turn one movi show best part trailerit hard give movi star rate well made easili bore batman film ever made enjoy movi even le clooney versionth film good look part like comic style substanc action scene well done short saw trailer basic seen surprisesther charact movi care catwoman annoy physic unattract yet forc romanc despit actor chemistryth riddler serial killer murder corrupt politician realli care batman stop kill evil guyson major thing film lack especi consid batman movi good villain riddler main bad guy realli isnt movi much never appear screen batman even caught batman watch outsid window polic arrest somewhat shown trailer batman later visit arkham separ glass also shown trailersa act everyon whisper movi except riddler randomli rais voic attempt act crazythank robert pattinson shown bruce wayn much movi look like frankenstein monster time shown youd think good thing much batman movi mostli stand around whisper bore conversationsth worst thing movi bore batman one fun charact ever creat sure manag make dull,neutral

998,No spoilers!!!Finally experienced the Batman the way we were supposed to! (Atleast in my opinion). Mat Reeves take on batman was excellent! He presented Batman in perfect way. Robert Pattinson done a wonderful job as Batman and the Riddler hits hard!! Music added more effect to the scenes (Goosebumps guaranteed!). Story is developed perfectly and ended in more realistic way.I personally recommend to watch this in Imax or theatre with better sound!,spoilersfin experienc batman way suppos atleast opinion mat reev take batman excel present batman perfect way robert pattinson done wonder job batman riddler hit hard music ad effect scene goosebump guarante stori develop perfectli end realist wayi person recommend watch imax theatr better sound,positive
999,"At the time of Writing this review, The Batman is easily my favorite movie of 2022 and my favorite DC movie of all time. I'm not the biggest Batman fan, but everything works for me in this movie. Pattinson creates my favorite onscreen Batman, Colin Farrell plays Penguin in such a way that he can move from being funny to serious within mere seconds, Zoe Kravitz is the first time Catwoman has been interesting, Jeffrey Wright is my definitive onscreen Gordon, Paul Dano is easily the best adaptation of the Riddler, and so on and so forth. The script is also excellent and does an especially great job of delivering a compelling mystery, which is at the core of the story. While most Batman movies only hint at his detective skills, none of them have gone into it as much as this one has. It makes for an extremely engaging and superbly paced story that manages to hold onto your attention for almost 3 hours, which is not an easy feat. The music is incredible and one of Giacchino's best scores, the cinematography is on another level of quality, the action is amazing and extremely easy to follow, the direction is excellent. Overall, this movie is one of my favorite comic book movies and an absolute must see for the year.",time write review batman easili favorit movi favorit dc movi time im biggest batman fan everyth work movi pattinson creat favorit onscreen batman colin farrel play penguin way move funni seriou within mere second zoe kravitz first time catwoman interest jeffrey wright definit onscreen gordon paul dano easili best adapt riddler forth script also excel especi great job deliv compel mysteri core stori batman movi hint detect skill none gone much one make extrem engag superbl pace stori manag hold onto attent almost hour easi feat music incred one giacchino best score cinematographi anoth level qualiti action amaz extrem easi follow direct excel overal movi one favorit comic book movi absolut must see year,positive
