        "Actually I enjoy coding in Python. When I was writing the code for claculator I felt like optimizing without brute force. I tried my level best in that. I look to optimize the code always. I wanted to reduce the code but as its assignment it should be clear to evaluate. So I mostly followed brute force. It was fun. As all the concepts are very similar and learnt in past, completing this assignments is very good. I founf difficulty in writing code for the 5th question. As I used nest lists and took time time to get to know on harmonic mean concept. Ofcourse I've researched online to get to know such things. I enjoy doing these type of assignments. I would love to work on all assignments, if all assignments are of this kind 😀."
